<h1>Phil Virgo Journal for 1995</h1>

<h2>Thursday, September 20, 1995</h2>
<p>
	Pablo has been attending a Quaker School in Bethesda that just opened
this fall.  He decided to go to this school the day before school started.  He
was offered a 100% scholarship for the head of the school - Don Cxxxx.  He met
Don at Catoctin Quaker Camp.  Don was creating a school that would be "just
like camp" - a student body that was relaxed, respectful of each other and the
world, intelligent, and loving.    Today there was no school - in the day there
was an emergency faculty meeting - in the night the faculty and the board of
directors met with the parents.  The meeting was to announce that the school is
bankrupt, with no money to pay teachers, staff, utilities.  Three faculty had
resigned and Don was having a psychotic episode.  He had taken his children and
disappeared.  They believed the obstacles were insurmountable and that the
school should close on Friday.  All tuition money was gone and not recoverable.
There were no complete financial records, but it looked like there was no
embezzlement - simply that Don had started the school before the business
issues had been resolved.  He did this on a faith that God would provide - and
during the previous months many obstacles seemed to fallen away miraculously.
He told the board (only the newest member of the board had ever served on a
board or had any knowledge of the responsibilities of a board) very little
about the finances - other than that they would not have enough money from
tuition to make it through the first year.  He said that this was not a problem
because of several wealthy people, who wished to remain anonymous (the board
doesn't know who these people are) would make up the difference.  28 of the 90
students attending had signed up within 3 weeks of the start of school.  Many
were given full or partial scholarships (all arranged by Don - and no one still
at the school knew what the specific arrangements were made with each
family..and there are no records).

Janice arranged to stay late at school on Monday (got home around midnight) so
I did the child care (diner, dishes, school work, etc.).  Since I had a lot of
deadlines at work and always the one to get the kids going in the mornings,
she agreed to take care of the evening child care Tuesday through Thursday.
But in stead of working I attended the school meeting.  Got home around 11:00
pm.  Janice had not come home at all.  Pablo had spent the night at the
computer, Josh had gone to bed.  Elisabeth and Stephanie were up and wanted a
lot of hugs and affection.  Every was worried about why mom was not home.  She
showed up around midnight, but dismissed my concerns about leaving the kids
home alone, and dismissed my request that she should call and tell us if she
was late.  She says she told Pablo she would be late and told him to baby-sit.
He had no memory of the conversation - and had been the first to say he was
worried about what might have happened to her.

<h2>Some time in 1995</h2>

<h3>International Hemophilia Collaborator's Meeting - Washington DC.</h3>

Interesting presentations by Phil Rosenburg and Tom O'Brien.

<h3>The Virgin and the Mousetrap</h3>
<p>
Some facts about 3 stars in the Big Dipper from "The Virgin and the Mousetrap"
(1993 Recorded Books) by Chet Raymo.  Recorded here FMI (for my information)
since although I read much about cosmology - I know little specifically about
the night sky.   
</p>
<p>
Duby, the star at the lip of the (big) dipper, is a yellow-orange giant star.
It is 10 times larger than the sun and 100 times more luminous.  It is 100
light years from here (1,000,000 years for the voyager space craft).  In its
"death throws", it is has expanded tremendously - engulfing any possible inner
planets.  Mirac is the start at the bottom front of the dipper's bowl.
Misar is the star at the bend in the handle of the dipper.  Misar is a
"sibling" to Mirac - they are both traveling out from their common origin in
the gases of a single nebula.   Both stars are younger and "many times"
brighter than the sun.  Misar is really 2 stars orbiting their common center of
gravity in 10,000 years.

The book is interesting especially because of the way he gives images of large
numbers (e.g.: there are as many stars in our galaxy and there are grains of
salt in 10,000 1 pound boxes of salt; there are more galaxies than there are
boxes of salt in all the super markets in the world).  But it is frustrating
that he then doesn't give the numbers - I wonder how many grains of salt there
are in a pound.  I wonder how he knows (especially true of the number of
supermarkets and average number of boxes per supermarket)!  
<p>

He says that if I took all the e-coli bacteria in my stomach and laid them end
to end they would stretch from New York to San Francisco.  My effort to
calculate the number and size of e-coli has had partial success.  I have
developed the following equation for perfect cubes:  L = D2 (ell equals dee
squared).  It took me an embarrassingly long time to come up with this (about a
hour while driving - but in my defense I was quite tired and emotionally
distraught at the time) - and so now I will write it down. 

<p> 
L is the length you want to span (as in the distance from coast-to-coast).
<br>D (denominator) is the divisor you need to apply to the length of
the cube's side to obtain the correct number of little cubes to span
the desired distance. 
</p>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>
What is the size of the equal cubes that total 1 cubic meter and
  laid end-to-end will span 4,000 kilometers?
  <br>L=D squared
  <br>4,000,000 meters = D squared
  <br>D = 2,000
Answer is that you divide the cubic meter into cubic 1/2 millimeters.

<h3>Example 2:</h3>
What is length of the side of each cube required to stretch 1 cubic
meter to a length of 25 meters?
<br>Answer is 1/5 of a meter (25 = 5 squared).
<br>Imagine dividing the 1 meter cube - the top layer has 5 rows of 5 cubes and
each row is 1 meter long - so the top layer will stretch 5 meters.  There are 5
layers  like the top layer, 5 * 5 = 25.


<h2>My miserable Home Life</h2>
<p>
I didn't stay through the entire meeting tonight.  Got home after 10:00 p.m..
Elisabeth was watching TV (past her bed time by 2 hours).  The trash was not
out.  There are no clean towels.  The dishes are not washed...etc.  Janice was
in bed  with a law book.  There are no plans for child care tomorrow other than
that Emily will take Ebeth, but no time has been set.  Janice will leave, as
always, way before any of the rest of us are up so child care is my problem.
She also announces that she is not able to leave school until 5:30 p.m. (which
means she can't be home before 7:00pm) because she is staying to take a make up
class. I am censoring the content of the conversation we had.  She was
obviously very angry (which makes her very bossy) - I asked if we could respect
the kids who were just getting to bed around us by speaking civilly and quietly
- or by going down stairs if she thought that would be a problem.  She did not
want to leave the bed.  It was a short "conversation" and I didn't provoke or
engage in rudeness.  She told me how I am not here for the family emotionally
or physically.  That I am irresponsible.  She then pushed me out of the room
(with body language - she approached and  began shutting the door - I was
standing in the doorway) and shut the door on my foot as I left.  There was no
milk in the refrigerator, so I went to the store to buy it.  I came back after
5 minutes to a locked front door with no porch light on.  There is obviously no
way I'll be able to get to work at a reasonable hour and I'll have to leave
early.  I may as well not go in.  Thank-you Janice for the agreement you made
to let me get extra work done this week!  You were home 2 of 5 days and didn't
do anything while you were here other than scold and boss the kids and me.
