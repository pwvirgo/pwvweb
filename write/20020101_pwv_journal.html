	<h2> Saturday, January 19, 2002</h2>

	<p>Susan spent the night, we saw the movie Goslinger Park.  In the morning I went out to buy breakfast supplies (bagels, half-and-half,pre-cut mellons &amp; berries, olives) .  It was snowing and the was a couple inches accumulation, so it was easy to see that the window on the sliding door on the van was gone - smashed in to broken glass and snow in the back seat.  I was supposed to pick up Stephanie at noon, and give Susan a ride to her car.</p>


<h2>Sunday, January 20, 2002</h2>

<p>Dream 8:15am: My sister and I are at a rest stop along a highway and I need to return a phone call from Grandma Virgo.  I find a discarded cell phone in the trash and determine there is still some life in the batteries and I place a call.  I dial in the wrong way and get a message indicating that these circuits are down and it will be illegal to continue with the call unless it is a true emergency.  I hang up and re-dial in on a non-emergency circuit.  I speak to a strange man at her house and hear the activity in the house over the phone.  She is being scolded and coaxed to get up and get to the hospital and escape from a bad situation with her health and home life.  She is old and tired and I think she must resent the pushy people trying to help her, this must be awful for her and perhaps it is an emergency for me to be there with her</p>

	 <h2>Wednesday, October 02, 2002</h2>

<p>Unhappy with Lou Yakstis - uncooperative colleague and Kim Banks (dishonest, blaming client).  This morning several thoughts occurred to me.  I REALLY want to be liked - I get very agitated and unhappy if someone disapproves of me.  I have taken pride in my life about being a non-conformist.  This thought hit like a revelation - another and I think - I am often relating to ideas as revelations - instead of just an insight.  (and it maybe that the same thoughts have been revelations to me repeatedly over the years).</p>
	 
<p>Being rejected is threatening - I am un-calm unable to sleep unhappy on edge - it is perhaps the fight or flight response.  By being awake I won't be ambushed?</p>

<h2>Sunday, October 13, 2002</h2>

<p>Take Elisabeth to Sandy Spring Meeting.  Go to Philips Collection to see Pierre Bonnard Exhibit. Sleep, dream. Paint.  Listen to tape on the French enlightenment.</p>

<h2>23 October, 2002 (the evening before the day before sniper was caught)</h2>

<p>Went for a hike in the woods and fields near my apartment.  Listening to an audio book "Ravelstein" by Saul Bellow.  I came out of the woods into a  large field of high grass and a Maryland State Police helicopter came across the field at about 100 feet over my head.  It then came back, and then passed over again, and then again.  At first I stared up at it as I walked, but then I just walked.  It was circling me.  It landed on a small hill about 50 yards ahead.  The pilot got out and I approached him.  He asked me to put my hands up, he search me, questioned me, studied my driver's license.  He said they were on the hunt for the sniper and had a tip that he was in this area.  I should leave the area.  I walked back towards my apartment and he flew off.  Soon a 4 wheel "motorcycle" with a cop and a squad car came into the field.  I was told to put my hands on my head, approach the unmarked car and lean over the hood with my hands on the hood.  I was searched, questioned,  told to leave.  Several marked and unmarked cars are moving across the field.  I leave the field walk down the train track.  Meet a state trooper who is on foot.  He wants to know if I have been questioned, "yeah first by the helicopter then by the guys in the cars" "Okay, better get out of the area" </p>

   <h3>NACMR:</h3>
   
   <p>Spoke with Bonita at CDC 404-639-4270 she is going to email the HARS documentation to me, but probably not for a couple of weeks. As there is a new version being released (in January with new race codes and icd10) and her system is down, and she is going on vacation next week, and she will be in training the week after that.</p>
   
   <p>	IBM tech support tells me to install 2 drivers MIGR-4R3UYS and MIGR-4LSP53. External Hard drive FRU number 09N4225, Computer Model No. 2652-M4U. I am told the Windows-XP is windows NT, and that I should be able to upgrade to xp. That I should first backup the IBMTOOLS and DRIVERS folders. Looked at the drivers - but the first was inappropriate. I did install the 2nd after running cleanup.exe. No help. Called Silvia but she is not in the office.</p>
   
   <p>Spoke with another IBM tech support rep by calling 800-772-2227 learned the existing service request number 1-143398860 (got my name added to Sylvia's. Learned that the recover disk was not delivered to Sylvia because of a wild card in the address caused it to be returned to IBM. Changed the mailing address to for the recovery cd to my address. Tech rep says the problem is that the Rapid Restore software (that was installed on the hard drive before I asked to have it removed) screws up the partitions so that the os cannot see the whole disk. I need to run a low-level format. To do this I</p>
   <ul>
    <li>	Go to <a href="http://www.pc.ibm.com">www.pc.ibm.com</a></li>
    <li>	Search for DFT</li>
    <li>	Click first item in list and then download the IBM Drive Fittness Test</li>
    <li>	Use it ti create a bootable floppy disk</li>
    <li>	Boot from the floppy</li>
    <li>	Select the ERASE DISK UTILITY (low level format) for the G: drive</li>
    <li>	Wait around for an hour or so for this to run</li>
   </ul>
   <br >
   <p>First I decide to update to Windows 200 SP3. Then attempt the DFT installation - the process fails to locate the hard drive in question. I call ibm tech support and Bill spends at least an hour with me. He knows that the DFT will not work. He knows that the G: drive is a backup partition of the disk 0 and NOT the USB port. We get the drive to work on the CSC laptop, but not on the new laptop. He concludes that we need to re-image the operating system.</p>

   <h2>Monday, January 13, 2003</h2>
   <p>Call IBM since I have not received the packing to send the laptop back. This time they work with me. They suggest that I upgrade the bios and the embedded bios control. If that fails to work I am to talk to the sales person and have the computer returned, He tells me to search the IBM web site for "MIGR-42654" and "MIGR-45770". I do and install the upgrades to bios and embedded bios control. This does not help. I write to Barbara and try and work out buying a new computer.</p>

   <h2>Tuesday, January 14, 2003</h2>
   <p>I sent back the back the internal hard drive "priority mail" according to instructions from Joe StockFish.</p>

   <p>I eat lunch with Susan. She seems fine! (This makes me both happy and sad - happy that she is doing well - and sad that I am so disposable. The day (last Thursday) that I told her I was thinking of going to a museum with a woman I contacted on an internet dating site - she went to diner with Mary-Anne and they stayed out late. She and Mary-Anne and Sherrie all laughed that I would be so naive as to think she would allow me to join a dating service). She says she has loved since she met me, but cannot afford to get to upset if we part, because she cannot afford to start drinking so she'll just go ahead and have good life without me. She said that people might at any moment meet up with someone that would meet there needs better than there current partner and that when that happened they would naturally move on - everyone knows that - it is the nature of life. But she cannot hold her head up as a woman if she allows me to actively look for a replacement. I am welcome to sign up for classes or volunteer work and fall in love - but not join a dating service. I do very little talking. I have wanted to talk with her, but I am pretty sure it would be a waste of time - she is doing fine. She said, "we might talk about it more deeply - but that is likely just to bring out problems and resentment - its best not to go there". She mentions that she had lost 15 pounds - she thinks because of having 3 temporary crowns that kept falling out since last October - she said she plans to keep that weight off. She says that she needs to win one more Hemophilia contract to keep her financially afloat, and not become a street person in her old age. I left work early today - tonight I was just crying so hard and feeling so bad! I was thinking I should write letters to Susan, even if I don't deliver them now - so I can remember what I was actually thinking over time - and maybe someday it would be correct to share with her.</p>
   
<p>Dear Susan,</p>

   <p>Today you told me "I've loved you since I met you". I love you too. I remember when we both refused to say that - and only once before have we ever admitted that. It is too stupid to wait until we are saying adieu to say this! I am thinking so many thoughts that I don't dare to share for fear of causing pain to you - you are so confident you can sail on without me, I will not disturb your un-natural ease of letting go. I think it has a name - anti-depressants (Zoloft), sleep medicine, and god knows what other drugs you are on - I hope you are not taking Rosie's Valium? You told me that if you seem very cold it is not how you feel, but you cannot afford to feel too bad because you cannot risk drinking. I will not challenge this, but I am so unhappy that you are on this new set of drugs - better than drinking I agree. I think these medicines are probably also largely responsible for the huge gap in our interest in sex, I think they probably lower your passions in general.</p>
    
   <p>How sad I am!!!! I think of our couple of weeks on Martha's Vineyard with great gratitude to you - not just for those days, but for all of the ways you have showed me new places, new ways of being. I think of how ridiculously lustful we once were and all the crazy places we managed to get-it-on! Oh how I wish I could hold you and hold you under the covers - it hurts so bad! When we left the Vineyard this summer we were annoyed at each other - I wanted to pour some half-and-half on to the sand driveway - and you told that you and your brother did not approve of such behavior and it would not be allowed. I told you were irrational. We did not sit at smile and talk on the ferry - we avoided each other. I had this great sadness then - looking at the great beauty and the thinking fondly of our time together - I felt strongly that I would never be back there with you again. I cried then into the wind.</p>
  
  
   <p>I entered a dating service looking for a friend - because I could not betray you and look for a lover. I need both. I completely disagree that I could join a club and accidentally fall in love with someone else - I am not asleep - it would be a choice to engage that person and allow love to blossom. I did not know where to find the courage to talk about my needs and hurt you. I needed to be honest with the world and although you picked up on the obvious danger of the dating service you have yet to notice that I would not get anywhere on a dating service being honest about our 15 year love affair. I would probably have given up very quickly and returned for a while to my lonely life. I need to be honest - not as favor to you - I need to be honest in order to live with myself.</p>
   
   <p>It is clear to me that you are looking out for yourself in a way that I find almost impossible to do for myself. My tears and pain are partly the disloyalty I feel, but your concerns - your clear demands for your own dignity your own financial security, your right to friends and good times seems like a great neon sign telling me that I MUST also lookout for Phil - no one else is doing that! (You are very clear that these and many other things are more important to you than I am, this is not a complaint - although I do see myself as being somewhat under-rated in your value scheme!).</p>

   <p>	So am I a great hypocrite? I have not lied but I haven't opened up and talked about what I need. I want to laugh and talk about being human, about how I feel, but I am afraid to hurt you. It would turn out badly - a set of demands - I need more sex, look at my paintings and try and understand them, turn off those stupid TV shows, read these books and talk with me about them, get some hiking books and hit the trail with me, learn my politics, listen to this band, love Dylan, and Bach, and the Beatles, - stop taking all those goddamed pills, take me to Ireland and Hawaii --- how awful it sounds! Just the thing you describe as the worst part of your relationships with all the prior men in your life - dear god I don't want to change you - I just need someone to share more of life with and demanding it of you would not work. As it is you are perfectly happy to see me once a week, spend a few hours and we go our own ways. It gets worse - you love me right? You have money and we would both love to travel - but you are waiting for years until I can pay my own way. It wouldn't be that way if I had money and you didn't - we would be traveling. Would it never end? </p>

  
   <p>I need to be working, but I keep crying and crying. I think if you can take this in stride I need to move ahead and cry in private.</p>
  
   <p>I love you Susan (oh but if we were not saying good-bye I would be very careful of these words and spend some time proving that their meaning is quite vague - and both are honest). I want the best for us both.</p>
  
   <p>All my love, Phil</p>
