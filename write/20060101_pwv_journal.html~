<h1> 2006 pwv journal</h1>

<h2>Sunday, January 31, 2006</h2>
	  
<p>Siiting in my living room tonight.  Listening to the State of the Union on
the couch, there was a noise which turned out to be my palm tungsten e2 (note
to future generations: this is like a small electronic
notepad/calculator/calendar/addressbook - called PDA's they were popular for
several years). landing on the floor next to me.  The odd thing is that it did
this spontaneously and it landed about 2 feet from the filing cabentent it had
been on.  It somehow landed in the floor 2 feet from any piece of
furniture.</p>

<p>This is true.</p>

<h2>March 23, 2006 - a dream</h2>

<p>Along the side of the road a stopped car, a man on his cell phone. I
continue walking and there on a hillside beside the road is the same dog, but
now he is alert.  This dog looks like a Doberman but very large.  Black and
brown, he has a brown star of David on his black flank.  I say hello and he
comes to me.  We make each other's acquaintance.  He seems like a good
upstanding dog, but I wonder if I kept him how I would establish my dominance,
he is certainly bigger and tougher and more heavily armed than me.  I am
walking home with a friend and our new dog friend. He is walking ahead of us
carrying a map, like a person in his front limbs while walking on the back two.
Since he has never been to my house, it is interesting that he looks at the map
and makes each turn before we signal it and leads us to the back porch.  He
folds the map. I know he used his nose to track back to my house, but I ask him
if he can read maps. "No, I can't, I can't even read the time from a clock."  I
say I am amazed that he even understands what a clock is for and he agrees that
the other dogs he knows don't really pay any heed to clocks or know what they
are for.</p>

<h2>2006-06-02 a dream</h2>

<p> I woke up several hours ago from an intense complex dream, that I cannot
quite remember right now, but at the end I was sitting at a long crude plank
covered table in the woods at a meal with people from a couple of tribes (a
word not used in my dream). The spiritual guru of one group was telling the
people the deep facts about life. The spiritual guru from the other tribe was
hiding behind a tree, listening. And what he said was that who you are is not
your sensations, thoughts, emotions, or body. Who you really are is the Will.
And then I sort of knew that I was living in a play by Samuel Beckett and that
Beckett was strongly influenced by Nietzsche. When I woke up I was entranced
by the whole of the dream and rehearsed it so I would remember (that failed),
I was also interested that this final lecture about the will was something I
had been dreaming about recently. Although I did not remember those other
dreams, I knew this was one among many, and felt the continuity of my dream
self.</p>

<h2>July 30, 2006</h2>

<p>Just a word about a dream I had a week or more ago. I was with high school
friends and teaching them how to fly along a few feet off the ground as a
quick and exhilarating way to travel about. And then I was thinking that this
flying business is one of the contradictions in my life. I know from modern
physics that it is not possible, and I am a skeptic about things that are not
possible, but somehow I just segregate these to different parts of my life and
continue living both realities. I decided I needed to stop and think through
the explanation as to how I could be flying in spite of the conflict with my
other ideas. How could modern physics have gotten this wrong? There is always
the old explanation from my youth that this life is really just a staged test
and maybe once I notice the obvious flaws the illusion will be broken and I'll
meet the testers and go on to a more real reality. But that idea is getting
old. I never came up with a good answer. After I awoke the answer seemed
pretty clear; I'd been dreaming, but nothing like that had occurred to me in
the dream although I was trying hard to find an answer. Now that I read this I
see that the idea of this being some kind of an illusion could be close to the
correct idea of a dream by the awake.</p>

<p> Last Sunday I went to the National Gallery to see a big exhibit of Henri
Rousseau: Jungles in Paris. I found it pretty wonderful. Many, mostly large
paintings lots of them with peaceful or deadly encounters in the jungle. There
is no point telling you about the paintings – you can research that yourself.
They also had a large room devoted to the influences upon Henri, including a
wall covered with the covers of the magazine for which he worked; many violent
scenes like the tiger trainer being attacked by the tiger, the snake about to
kill it's handler. A great scene of an Englishman in a “Landrover” (circa
1910) with the top down and a great happy regal lion with it's mane blowing in
the wind in the passenger seat, while all the startled natives scampered out
of the way. They had sculptures from Henri's Paris of a mother bear and a
hunter killing each other; the dead bear cub suspended by a rope around it's
neck hanging form the hunter's belt. A large gorilla abducting a fainted half
nude young European woman.</p>

<p> When I returned to my car the passenger front window had been smashed and
my backpack was gone. (T)(s)he(y) left the cell phone on the seat, the gps and
binoculars in the glove compartment, the “How to listen to and Understand
Great Music – Volume II” and lots of other stuff in the car. Just the Backpack
with my pastels, paper, other art supplies was gone.</p>

<p> Last Wednesday I left work early and went for an hour bike ride, a little
after 4 in the morning on Thursday I woke up with intense chest pains (I rated
them a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1 to 10) which I found frightening. I called
Kaiser and ended up driving myself to the emergency room at the Shady Grove
Hospital. I was fine by 9 am but ended up staying until early afternoon when I
was given an echo imaging of my heart before and after a stress test on a
treadmill. I was told by heart was beautiful and strong and experiencing no
problems. I asked the doctor if it was okay for me to do intense exercising
and he said yes. I asked if I should get another stress test when I was 60 to
see if that was still okay and he said no - if I kept the exercise going I
would also be fine in my 60's and did need anymore tests.</p>

<p> Yesterday I went for a bike ride at Little Bennet State park. There where
lots of freshly blown-over trees. I decided to return to my car by road rather
than going back a few miles on the trails. I ended up in the very strong hot
sun riding much further that I expected. I found an entrance back to one of
the trails after a few miles on the road, but it was blocked by a big tangle
of trees with the biggest fallen one on top. There was no easy way through and
I was concerned with the poison ivy, so back to the road. Fortunately, I was
soon back to the car, and not sun burnt. I had plenty of ice water with me.</p>

<p> Today my brother Jim called to tell my that my uncle Jim had died. He had
had heart failure and was living on machines for a week before they pulled the
plug and he died at age 83. This is the same age that his older brother, and
my father, had died. He had had triple bypass surgery at some time in the last
few years. His wife Jeanne and all of his (Darryl and Wayne) and her kids (Rob
and Steve) are still alive.</p>

<h2>November 24, 2006</h2>

<p>Thoughts on the drive to sugarloaf.</p>

<p> Am I having thoughts or am I a medium in which thought develops and
propogates? It seems that most of my thoughts come to me from books, lectures,
parents, friends, a very small percentage of my thoughts are original. I have
certainly had no BIG orginal thoughts like f=m*a, e=mc^2, or “am I a meduim
for thoughts”. My thinking self is a cauldron, a society, a ecosystem of
thoughts collected and distributed though centuries and from all over the
planet.</p>

<p> Is there something to be done about this insight, some further step, some
new way of walking? Some urgency to understand our true identitiy? Should I
help the people wake up to the fact that they are not free agents, but
ecosystems of thoughts which may not have the best interests of the
individual, the society, the species, or organic life as it's goal? Or if I
am, in fact, an ecosystem of thoughts should my alegence to this body,
personality, society, life on earth change to reflect my “true” self – a
system of though? Could there be a battle between thought and the individual,
between though and life? Could we stop thinking, or contain thinking in such a
way that thought does not rule the world?</p>

<p> Since I have failed to think original universal truths like f=am is it
misguided to think I could takle the relationship between life, identity, an
though? Is this a really futile quest?</p>

<p> Genetics is older than thought, can it be that thought is not as powerful
as it's vehicle?</p>

<p> Going for a hike.</p>
