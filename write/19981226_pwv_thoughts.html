<h1>PWV Saturday, December 26, 1998</h1>
<h2>Bad Dreams</h2>
<h2>Multiple levels of reality.</h2>

<p>Quantum physics-&gt; relativity physics; physics-&gt;chemistry;
chemistry/physics-&gt;biology; single cell-&gt;multi-cell organisms;
organisms/ecology; chemistry/physics-&gt;thought,emotion, perception;
etc.  Are the "lower" levels responsible for the "higher"
levels (that is are the higher levels epiphenomena),  or do the
higher exist "independently", using the lower levels as their
expanded laws of physics"?</p>

<p>Are the laws of physics sufficient to explain the walk I took with Maggie,
including her leash, rabies tag, my high tech hiking shoes?   Could
it be that this is all determined by the physical laws, or has
biology, economics, culture changed the outcome of physical events? 
If so how is it possible to change the outcome
of events without violating the underlying laws?</B></p>

<p>If my desire to eat ice cream actually causes me to buy a freezer, the
effects on the physical world are enormous.  Roads, factories, trucks
are built, gravel pits, iron mines, coal mines, smog, trees cut,
ozone depleted, habitats destroyed/created/changed, careers created,
lives changed.  Is my desire caused by brain chemistry, evolutionary
predisposition to sweets, or by cultural exploitation, expectation,
habituation?</p>

<p>Is the division between the 'lower' and 'higher'
levels just the compartmentalization of thought/mind/knowledge, or is
the mind perceiving an external division?  The patterns of foam on
the surf responds to a different environment than the atoms of water,
the slope of the wave,  the currents of air and water, structural
strength of the foam film, the atmospheric pressure, the kinetic
energy of its' own movement, the sound of the surf and the angry
duck.</p>

<p>How are the law of physics (which I assume to be some zoo of particles
subject to 3 or 4 forces) sufficient to explain things?  We need the
laws of evolution, supply and demand, territorial behavior.</p>

<p>Stop.</p>
<h2>Mechanical vs. Creative, Mechanical vs. Truth</h2>

<p>Thought as mechanical process, the person (J.Krishnamurti) expressing this
is engaged in that mechanical process.  He speaks of a truth beyond
that, but, by definition, he would not be able to express that truth.</p>

<p>A musician depends on muscles  performing precisely repeatable sequences.
  These are many small patterns that are woven together in higher order
patterns.  The training may be tedious and long.  These are perfected
mechanical processes, which may be used creatively to create new,
perhaps spontaneous musical creations. </p>

<h2> A Rush </h2>

<p>Creative thoughts sometimes come in a great rush one after another,
astonishing and very pleasant!  When this happens
I cannot capture the many events, I have no camcorder of the mind so
I can return to examine, expand, revise.  The very acrobatics,
dances, whimsies, depths, flights of thought are a pleasure in their
own right - regardless of the value of the content..  This morning it
happened in the bath and this writing is a terribly inadequate
representation of some of the topics that I still remember that were
steaming through me.  I had bath foam in the tub and when I looked at
it, the changing patterns were a part of the process.  Random shapes
of great beauty, creatures, attitudes, fate unfolding in succession
as my brain generated interpretations, and meta-interpretations of
meaning for itself.  I watched with great pleasure, began wondering
about physical descriptions (if it appears to be branching structures
then how many branches are likely to meet at the same point.  A 3 way
junction can be seen as body and legs, a four way cross can be the
arms trunk, neck./head.  Are branching structures part of my
perception or part of the eventsâ€¦).</p>

<p>I lifted my arm from the water, and every shape was perforated with small
holes.</p>

<p>I lack the
training and skill, but not the sensibility, of the musician.  If I
had a solid grounding in mathematics, what would become of my
thoughts?  If I could write, if I could paint, etc.  The paragraph
above has several problems, the language is not precise because I am
not clear on basic ideas.  "Flights of thought" is probably an
untruth.  Thoughts are not alive, they are cultural building blocks,
infections, tools, propaganda, memes. It is the brain that is
soaring, juggling thoughts with a gleeful bravado, surfing, skiing.
