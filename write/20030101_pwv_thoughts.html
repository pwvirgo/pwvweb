   <p>All judgments are mental. They may be about the non-mental world, they may be about the mental world, the cultural, the emotional, the religious, etc. they may (as in this paragraph) be about themselves. </p>
   
   <p>Our knowledge of the world is far beyond the ability of our individual minds to encompass. Even if our minds were much more powerful and capable of manipulating several dozens of simultaneous variables, they would be feeble compared to the complexity of the world and utterly dependant on conventions, shortcuts, morality, unquestioned assumptions in order to navigate. Our lives are far too short to discover much on our own. (what about Newton?)</p>
   
   <p>What about today's great ideas (Dawkins, Gould, Dennet, Kant, Hume, Einstein, Popper, Newton,) all doomed to extinction by gradualistic, catastrophic forces. </p>
   
   <p>Analogies and metaphors. The evolution of culture (the life of the mind). Biological evolution is based upon molecules capable of carrying information through vast eons of time. The genetic material as the memory and the proteins as the actors in the now. In human culture there is the cultural artifacts (tools, religion, moral precepts, practical techniques) as the memory and the individual mind as the actor in the now. Books are a quantum leap in the power of culture.</p>

     <p>     How can an idea change the world? I am talking of a materialistic
     world exclusively governed by the types of processes that physics attempts
     to understand.  What we have is some tiny electro-chemical event in a
     human brain.  The idea is to build a bridge across some river in West
     Virginia. The thinker is a Californian in a Hong Kong hotel.  The bridge
     is built a year later.  To explain this from physics 101 is the problem.
     Certain electrical charges, neural transmitters in the brain case in Hong
     Kong - take that as the arbitrary beginning point in a chain of cause and
     effect spreading though the world, use it to explain as an unbroken chain
     of physics (of the 4 forces probably the eltro-magnetic and
     gravitational are all one needs.  Classical physics will probably suffice;
     it is unlikely the quantum effects, or the details of subatomic particles
     need to be brought into this explanation).  So this small electro-chemical
     event, in the brain of the man in Hong Kong, spreads until there is
     combustion in the cylinders of a large truck carrying concrete down a
     quarry road in West Virginia.  A huge vat of molten steel is poured into
     some gizmo in Pennsylvania, a Turkey in Ohio is killed when a certain
     physical event severs it's head.  This turkey business is a huge complex
     chain it itself, covering 100s of miles, tons of materials, 10,000s of
     people (large physical machines to be explained) that eventually lead
     certain products of materials from that turkey to set off some muscle
     tissue in the arm of the truck driver that turns that large truck left at
     the second stop sign outside the quarry.  Even if a speeding car is racing
     down the highway by that stop sign at the exact moment the truck is set to
     turn left, this will not derail the ultimate delivery of the concrete.
     That turkey molecule will be used for some other process; a molecule from
     a cow from Texas will be the key molecule in the muscle tissue at a later
     time that turns that truck left.  If the truck crashes, the contents are
     spilled and the driver is taken of the job to recuperate the chain of
     events is not derailed the little 2 watt chemical storm in Hong Kong has
     determined that another truck will arrive, the bridge will be built. But
     it seems likely that to explain the chain of events that includes the
     unexpected crash, will require the inclusion of billions of physical
     events.  </p>

The world is completely in the mind.  Imaging a conscious computer.  John Searl and the Chinese box.  The human mind is no different.  Electrical impulses represent the world, later, brains learned to represent themselves.  These electrical impulses are all we can know about the world. Time and space are good tricks learned by brains. We have absolutely no way to 
</p>
<p>
There are times when any idea leads to more in profusion and the insights all seem fresh.  One might develop some profound new theory of physics in such a state?  One might just go with it and the content will be lost? One might focus on the experience itself.
</p>
<p>
I hear a story about a poet who had a vision that delivered to him 120 complete brilliant poems.  At that moment the tax man arrived at the door.  Only 6 of the poems where left by the time the poet got to write them down.

<p>
How many things can one successfully manipulate in one's head (6?,8?) so one needs math or a natural language, a pen an paper, and break the trance and write a small something in order to advance the culture's understanding of anything.
