        <h2>Saturday, May 17, 2003</h2>
        <p>Just back from NYC on Amtrak. Was supposed to go to Kampala, but the trip
            was canceled due to a state department warning for Americans to stay out of
            airports in Kenya. On Friday (16th) I was doing a match of the NYC AIDS
            registry to the NYS Cancer registry - but there were problems and it did not
            completely work. Must write corrective software and return to finish on
            Monday morning.
        </p>
        <p>Spent the night at Ann Prewitt's house (sister to Bob Biggar) in Hastings
            on Hudson. She is a big-wig at the museum of natural history in Manhattan.
            She has a spectacular house! She is the sister of Bob Biggar (who is
            61).
        </p>
        <p>At a wonderful shop "EVOLUTION" on Spring street in the Soho in NYC I
            bought a fossil fish (Diplomystus dentatus from the Green River Formation
            Wyoming. Eocene epoch 50 million years old) and 2 fossil Ammonites
            (Pseudoclymenia species Erfoud, Morocco. Late Devonian Period - 360 million
            years old). Very pretty polished (marble?).
        </p>
        <p>I was sleeping with the radio on, WETA classical music. I was dreaming
            half awake trying to change the channel but now mater how I moved the dial
            it was classical music. I woke up enough to turn it off. Then I was one many
            people in a large room, each on our own beds, being interviewed by a man.
            The interview was teaching him about us and it was very sophisticated, so
            that we could not understand what exactly was being discovered. . "Would you
            rather be bruised or interxxx ?(this was some common word I cannot
            remember)", he asked and went from bed to bed to hear each answer. When he
            came to me I could not see him, but I sensed he was there. "I don't know
            what interxxxx means." I said. "It means have small tunnels penetrating your
            anus and penis". "I'd rather be bruised". He moved on, and I contemplated
            what answers we were expected to give, it might even be that at some point
            the correct answer would be to refuse to answer.
        </p>
        <p>I was awake and the
            sense that someone was in the apartment, right by my bed, was very strong.
            This happens all the time; I know there is no one there and try not to
            acknowledge the illusion by looking. But, as often happens, the feeling of
            someone being right next to me grew very intense. I cannot tell if this is a
            neutral or an evil being.  It gets scary, then my brain began to sing in a
            familiar high pitch and my whole being was ringing with the loud vibration.
            The feeling that I was in a life and death situation was very strong. I was
            torn between trying to see the situation objectively without panic or
            judgment, and appealing to Jesus Christ for help. I wanted very much to take
            the first course but was becoming very scared. I said the Lord's Prayer
            several times. At last I opened my eyes and looked about to prove that there
            was no one at my bedside. I got up and did my ritual search of the apartment
            to be sure no one was here but myself.
        </p>
        <p>I noticed it was 3:00 am and
            remembered that "Fresh Air" was going to be on with some interesting topic.
            I tuned in the radio and listened for several minutes to an interview with
            the author of "Sea Biscuit". The mundane world reasserted itself.
        </p>
        <p>I've been singing the Incredible String Band song:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;Death is unreal<br />
            That's the way that I feel<br />
            There's more to be revealed<br />
            Lovers and friends meet again and again<br />
            On the dear old<br />
            On the dear old<br /> 
            On the dear old Battlefield.<br /> 
        </p>
        <h2>Wednesday, August 06, 2003</h2>
        <p>At the Baltimore/Washington airport listening to techno dance music on my
            headphones. There is a man across the large room several rows of seats from
            here and he is bouncing in his seat the beat of the music I am listening to.
            His ears are naked.

        <h2>Friday, August 8, 2003</h2>
        <p>Yesterday the San Diego Match was done successfully. Tabatha from the
            AIDS registry, Tom and Kathleen?? K and T both very pregnant. From the
            Cancer registry. Today I went to Torrey Pines State Park. Body surfed for a
            half hour or so then waked the beach and climbed the hills. It was very
            beautiful and I was having a great time. I eventually went back and got my
            sandals shorts and camera. With the camera in hand the experience lost some
            of it's great joy, but still it was wonderful. On the Flight from San Diego
            to Seattle I noticed my sun-burn. By the time I got into the hotel I was
            bright red and in pain. "Reading the Life of Pi".
        </p>
        <h2>Saturday, August 9, 2003</h2>
        <p>Wasted a couple of hours going to the emergency room - to be told I had
            sunburn. (I knew this - and if this was all they planed on doing - why waste
            so much time admitting and discharging me? Went to Mt Rainer and took a 7
            mile round trip hike to the lowest elevation glacier in the US. Old growth
            forest. Huge trees. The glacier seemed to be a pile of rocks. I guess the
            ice was underneath. The rocks would sift and crash no and then. I tries to
            hike a little higher to see if I could see some white snow and ice - but it
            became so foggy I could see nothing.
        </p>
        <p>Below is my idea that I elaborated for some time with great elegance as I
            walked the trail on Mt Rainer. When I attempt to write it, it loses its
            umph. Is this woman based on Maryland Monroe or on Virginia Woolf. How can I
            tell this story so that the twist at the end - that she is not in our
            universe and therefore not a woman of our species, in fact the physical laws
            of her universe maybe unknown to us.
        </p>
        <p>There was a woman. She did not know the source of her life, the natural
            laws that made life possible. She did not know all of the philosophical
            explanations. She lived her life sometimes with great gusto, sometimes in
            deep anguish. These deep emotions were related to the events of her life,
            but not caused by the events. At some times the joy of flying, dancing,
            fucking, relating was perfect. At other times it all seemed to shallow and
            pain was everywhere. She dealt with this from her childhood through
            maturity, and one time she had had enough. She ended her own life. I do not
            know how she did this, in some gruesome act of bravery, or did she make sure
            to lose consciousness and depart without the additional pain of the death?
            She died. She is gone. In her blood stream gases are expanding in bubbles.
            Our universe is one of these expanding bubbles in the dead body. In some way
            she is the creator of the universe we know - but she is not like the
            Christian God - she did not will our universe, nor did she know of it. 
        </p>
        <p>So you tell me I made this up, no I am a religious prophet - I have been
            given this truth of reality in a mysterious communication from someone who
            knows. The God of Moses was the God of the Hebrew people - he was trying to
            show he was more powerful than the other Gods (whom he acknowledged by the
            fact of his competition with them). He could turn a stick into a snake- so
            could the other gods. He could murder thousands of innocent Egyptian men
            women and children, in order to impress their king, but actually failed to
            move the king - as God already knew. So why did he kill all of those people?
            Over time the God of the Hebrews becomes grander and may even be responsible
            for the whole planet - although his cosmology is so distorted it is clear he
            has no knowledge of the nature of the solar system. Later God became the lord of
            the universe. But what about the world beyond the universe?
        </p>
        <p>No, God is not so limited and silly and cruel as the sacred texts would
            have us believe - it is the ignorance of the prophets who did their best to
            communicate something beyond there understanding. Then how will you judge my
            prophesy?
        </p>
        <p>How does this story relate to the Buhhda's story of the ring floating on
            the ocean and the turtle how rises once every thousand years to take a
            breath?
        </p>
        <h2>Wednesday, August 13, 2003</h2>
        <p>On a plane almost back to Baltimore Washington Airport at 9:00 pm,
            returning from Seattle. Ran the match in Seattle on Monday, spent rest of my
            free time on Mt. Rainer, Went to xxx, then to Sunrise, then to Paradise. At
            Sunrise I was around 7,000 feet and the visibility was often about 50 feet.
            At Paradise I climbed (from 5,400) to about 8,000 feet and lots of snow.
            Most people were sledding or skiing and there were at least a dozen people
            there (this was on the trail to Muir camp). Most had some real mountain
            boots and poles. Many were sliding down great short steep slopes on their
            feet, on their fannies, some had brought along plastic garbage bags to use
            as sleds. A woman gave me a piece of a black plastic bag, which I used for a
            sled.

            cottage on the lake DeRuyter NY on August 16, 2003.  We took my
            1999 Honda Civic and a rented Nissan Altima from Middletown MD.  We
            picked up Pablo in Philadelphia, where he and Arin and 5 others had
            just occupied their new house for 2 days.  They had no gas, they
            couldn"t cook, and they took cold showers. They were getting to
            know their neighbors and looking for work. 
        </p>
        <p> We bought groceries.  Phil bought Maggie a new Frisbee, and new
            16 foot retractable leash, a new choke collar since she had none of
            these.
        </p>
        <p> We played relaxed in great sunny weather. Liz and Phil went
            swimming. We took pictures.  We visited Jim and Deb, and Deb served us
            a great meal.  Jim and Deb helped Phil understand entropy, Jim loaned
            out his chemistry and physics books. We read books and hiked in
            Highland forest.  Pablo had diarrhea for several days.  Phil scolded
            Elisabeth for sleeping too late; Elisabeth didn't appreciate this, but
            they were friends again after a while.  
        </p>
        <p> Arin came up from Philadelphia in her Volvo. Barb and Jim Hobbs
            came down from Canada, where they had done a flea circus and vacationed
            in Toronto.  Jim and Deb and Ben and Alison and Phil and Pablo and
            Stephanie and Elisabeth and Maggie and Jim and Barbara and Ruth and
            Adam and his friend and Kimberly and her friend played and talked at
            the camp.  Jim H. played the small organ. Jim H. had Elisabeth and
            Stephanie juggling. 
        </p>
        <p> We read books.  Liz and Steph both read the new Harry Potter book.
            Phil and Elisabeth went swimming.  Maggie played Frisbee with everyone.
            Liz and Steph both beat Phil at card games.  Various people won Chinese
            checkers. Jim spent a few minutes teaching Phil to play "summertime" on
            the guitar.  We looked through things of Rod and Dorothy Virgo.  
        </p>
        <p> We said good-bye.  Pablo and Arin went to Philadelphia to set up
            house and look for work. Barb and Jim went to visit Jim's brother on
            MD's eastern shore.  Steph, Liz, Maggie, and Phil returned to MD.
            Steph went back to College.  Liz started the 9th grade.  Phil went to
            work.  Jim went to work.  Barb went to work.  Deb and Ruth and Ben and
            Alison relaxed and read books and enjoyed sunny days.  Maggie went to
            sleep on the living room.

   <p>I spent 9 days at Martha's Vineyard with Susan, we are now in the airport
   in Providence Rhode Island waiting to fly back to BWI airport.  We both had
   a very nice vacation.  Hurricane Fabian was 500 miles away but it produced a
   couple of sunny days with little wind but large surf.  It looked a little
   too big and rough to play in, but it was fun to watch.  On other days we
   swam (never together).  Thom Wilson was there for a couple of days and he
   handed me his GPS.  I spent a few days learning to use, mapping my hikes and
   drives.  Most days were spent at the beach.  I also saw several movies. Thom
   had us watch "A little bit of Paradise" a silly old black and romance
   between to con artists in Venice Italy.  S &amp; I also watched  "The Gray
   Fox" - a movie she selected about a train robber in the early 20th century.
   I saw a great Japanese movie "Rxx" a re-write of Shakespear's "King Lear".
   A Documentaries about Noam Chomski and Jack Keroac.  Several games of the US
   Open Tennis - including the semi-final and final with Justine H.H.</p>
   
   <p>Jack Keroac was a great typist, he would get a good night's sleep and a
   good breakfast and then type his book "On The Road" for 8 hours at a
   sitting.  He did not wish to be slowed by changing paper so he used large
   rolls of teletype paper.  He did not use space to break the wok into
   paragraphs, but just streamed the entire day's work.  He would leave a few
   blank lines at the end of each day's work.  It took him 21 days to complete
   the book.  Someone critiqued the book saying, "this is not writing, it is
   type-writing"</p>
   
   <h2>Friday, September 19, 2003</h2>
   
   <p>Hurricane Isabel just passed through.  It was a tropical storm when it go
   here.  I went walking from midnight until 2 in the morning.  The wind was
   strong at times (maybe 60 mph gusts - my unscientific estimate).  I was
   surprised that for those 2 hours it did not rain, that made it more
   comfortable.  There was some traffic on the streets, and some traffic on
   I-270.  CSC kept it's offices open although the metro subway and bus system
   was closed much of the time, and this morning half the employees have no
   power.  I am taking today and half of yesterday off to look around.</p>

   <p>I wet the bed this morning.  I was dreaming that I was at Susan's house
   (a big beautiful house in the dream) I was watching a great masterpiece of
   intelligent artsy public TV show.  She when upstairs and watched some
   network series on another TV. She and Phil Owens went shopping.  I got out
   the electric guitar.  When they returned Phil had been seriously hurt, I
   think he had a broken leg.  I was not concerned with his welfare; I wanted
   him to show me how to play Summer-Time on the guitar.  I took a bath and as
   I let the water out I began to pee in the bathtub.  I knew Susan would not
   approve but I figured I could finish and wash away any traces before she
   noticed.  The peeing was intensely pleasurable, and became painfully
   pleasurable.  I was starting and stopping the flow to experience the joy and
   avoid the pain.</p>
   
   <h2>Sunday, September 21, 2003</h2>

   <p>I was dreaming this morning that Paul DeSantis and I and some others (who
   I cannot remember) were walking along a busy road at night, avoiding the
   cars, there were no sidewalks.  I saw a 4 propeller plane struggling to lift
   itself at a steep angle.  There was a fanatic and toxic looking turbulent
   flow of green fluid behind plane, within this substantial green glow were
   short lived bursts of white light and yellow flame.  I pointed the plane out
   to the party I was with. There was some similarity between the scene behind
   the plane and  the sky in "Starry Night" by VanGogh, but this was a modern
   toxic green glowing fluid in the sky. The plane passed over the road to the
   side we were walking on and then stopped climbing and plunged tail first to
   the ground just beyond some one-story buildings in front of us.</p>
   
   <p>While meditating this morning I noticed how I had no control over the
   topic of my thoughts.  I decide to take control, to use free will to decide
   on a topic to think about; but the choices of topics come to me, I do not
   choose them.  I guess I could pick among them, but I cannot consciously
   select them my internal encyclopedia of topics, they are presented.  This
   reminds me of studies where they watch people's brain activity with MRI or
   CAT and tell the people to sit quietly and then "spontaneously" lift a
   finger without pre-meditation.  The subjects have a fast moving clock hand
   in front of them (the hand sweeps a full circle in less than 3 seconds) and
   are told to note the time of their decision on the clock.  The brain imaging
   shows that the brain activity preceding the lifting of the finger was 300
   milliseconds before the subject reported making the choice.</p>
   
   <p>I have been listening to CSPAN's Washington Journal for a couple of days
   and, as always I become angry at the low level of knowledge must callers
   have about topics they feel strongly about.  Later in the day while driving,
   I am angry at all the people in the SUV's, who do not need them, and are
   polluting the environment to be high status.  The common people should not
   be allowed to follow their own stupidity at the polls or the market place!
   Many of these people are well educated, surely they know about pollution,
   and internal combustion engines, they expect to have descendants living in
   this world, how ignorant can they be in order to satisfy their lust for
   status? I see a woman passenger with a joyous relaxed look to her - could a
   person have an experience of bliss and truth while living the sinful life of
   an SUV owner?  This is the issue of God's grace descending on the saint and
   sinner alike.</p>

   <h2>Friday, October 03, 2003</h2>
   <p>On the way to work I heard a woman say, "they thought he had been
   evicted, but now they know where the truth is".  This is very interesting.
   I think of the truth as being some quality belonging to a proposition, but
   this phrase suggests that the truth has its own existence; that it moves
   about, and takes up residence in a suitable neighborhood. It has also the
   possibility that it maybe sneaky, fickle, or secretive.  I don't think the
   woman was a native speaker of English, is this a Spanish turn of phrase?  I
   just repeated the quote to Susan; she said, "Sounds mysterious".   I told
   her my thoughts and she said it is a well know phrase "where the truth
   lies".  She thought it might be Shakespeare, but decided it was from the
   musical "Hair" - where the city is where the truth lies.  This she remembers
   because she was being indoctrinated by her boy friend that nature trumped
   the city, and this line gave her the idea that there might be more than one
   opinion on the mater.</p>
 
   <h2>Tuesday, October 07, 2003</h2>
   
   <p>I went to RTI for a meeting about establishing Technical Operating
   Procedures for the Viral Epidemiology contract.  John Heinrch, Barbara
   Kroner, Susan Wilson, Lilliana Preis (on the phone form her home in
   Argentina), and I were the participants.  The meeting went poorly.  I would
   say we don't have naming conventions on the lans.  Susan would contradict
   "sure we do, for example when I am working on UHS all of my files are names
   UAT1SWY.UHS". I replied those are the "naming convention on the
   mainframe, I am talking about the LANS.  On the LANS, each programmer tends
   to make individual choices about the names, but not in that format"  Susan
   replies "any permanent files I create all start with UAT1SWY.UHS and are all
   stored on the mainframe and the lan". Phil says "you use those same names on
   the LAN?"  Susan "yes".   At CSC we do not do this, I have been thinking we
   should institute such a policy, so tell me when you store a PDS on the LAN
   and the mainframe how do you synchronize the names?  Do you store the pds
   name as directory or do you save the entire pds name including the
   parentheses that are required to reference it on the mainframe?"  At this
   point I am aware that she doesn't do any of this, that she is struggling to
   come up with an answer that will not force her to say that she doesn't
   actually store her data that way - she is angry and embarrassed.  Liliana
   jumps into the discussion to cover for Susan.  I spend a great deal of time
   backpedaling.  "I don't know how Susan and Liliana store their data - at CSC
   we do not store ours in a one to one mapping of names between the mainframe
   and the lan, and this makes me uneasy that there is no simple convention to
   make the map" Susan and says she keeps complete documentation and sends it
   CSC via email every week, that if I would read it I would know where every
   program an every data file is on the mainframe.</p>

   <p>I attempted to speak as little as possible on the mater and take notes.
   When I did speak I emphasized the tasklog and repeated that I did not
   understand how Susan and Liliana store their data.</p>
   
   <p>Susan came out of the meeting extremely angry, bright red and screaming
   and throwing stuff in my car.</p>

   <p>The news hour had a story about  behavioral economics as applied to
   baseball.  Bad choices may lead to good outcomes, and good decisions may
   lead to bad outcomes.  Human nature normally rates the fear of regret as
   more important than the possibility of success.</p>
   
   <h2>Saturday, November 01, 2003</h2>

   <p>Went to the movie "Alien" with Susan last night.</p>

   <p>Is it true that all events are the result of prior events? Is this long
   chain of events of becoming cause becoming event becoming cause similar to
   electromagnetic waves oscillating at the maximum velocity? Is there a
   speed involved at all or are cause and effect instantaneous?
   Alternatively, if the exact relations of the strands of cause&amp;effect,
   woven into an immense n dimensional fabric of cause and effect is static,
   inevitable, deterministic, then there is no speed there is a structure that
   just is. Once we talk about the multiple dimensions including time then
   there is no beginning or end, although there may be outer edges.</p>

  <p>In this paragraph let us think of time the normal sense an unfolding of
  events rather than a static dimension among others. Now the question,
  given initial conditions does the world progress in an absolutely inevitable
  way such that there is only 1 possible outcome at any space-time
  coordinate? Would there be anyway to test such a hypotheses? So far no
  one has figured out anyway, so the question becomes something that we apply
  our intuition to. There is no correct answer. I am not sure how long it
  would take me to state the problem clearly, if that is possible, but I have
  no way to start off 2 independent universes with known conditions and track
  them through time. Perhaps I cannot state the problem clearly because it
  is a problem based on smaller ideas that do not actually link to each other
  in any meaningfully consistent and relevant way.</p>

   <p>Jim and Deb and Alison and Ben are here for Thanksgiving. My kids
   don't try an make it. Pablo says he doesn't want to be rude to
   the Parkers. Stephanie just doesn't talk about it. Elisabeth wants to
   come and makes some attempt to get here after the Parkers. Joshua is
   working. Barbara and Jim were supposed to come, but they needed to
   prepare for a conference.</p>

   <h2>Friday, December 19, 2003</h2>

   <p>It was this past Tuesday morning that I was dressing for work and noticed
   a couple of sweaters in a clear bag on a high shelf in my closet; there was
   a dark sweater on top and a light brown sweater beneath.  I thought about
   wearing the brown sweater which I had not noticed for many months and had
   forgotten about; but I chose not to.  For the first time in a year or so I
   decided not to take the government owned IMB Thinkpad laptop computer, upon
   which I am typing this sentence, to work.  I thought about the danger of it
   being stolen, as I noticed the back pack which contained it, but I left it
   on the living room floor.</p>

   <p>Returning from work I was surprised that my closet light was on, I don't
   leave lights on.  In the closet I noticed the bag with the sweaters, the
   light brown sweater was on top; someone had been in my apartment while I was
   gone. I checked for any other signs, for anything missing.  The laptop was
   still in the backpack, the mp3 player was not touched, my check-books seemed
   fine, and so on.  Nothing was missing, but someone had been going through my
   sweaters!</p>

   <p>The next day at work I called the apartment office to find out if there
   had been a maintenance person in my apartment, but they said not.  I
   explained the situation and talked abut having my locks changed. I got a
   call from Susan a few minutes later and she admitted that she had been in my
   apartment.  Frances heard my discussion on the phone and called to tell
   Susan.  Since Frances had reported to her on Tuesday when I was in the
   office so she could go and get a tie from closet in order to take it to the
   store and find a matching shirt for a Christmas gift.  What a relief, how
   unlikely that I would notice the sweaters, how fortunate Frances happened to
   hear my phone call and happened to be a part of the plot!</p>
 
   <h2>Friday, December 19, 2003</h2>

   <p>This morning's thoughts - maybe yesterday's.  There are times when my
   mind rushes ahead forming ideas much faster than I have time to notice one
   before it leads to another.  This is really fun and exciting.  There seems
   to be a progression of new ways of seeing, like opening a door into a new
   landscape and there is a glimpse of beauty and excitement at the newness.
   Then the mind beings to focus on some feature, and this triggers a new twist
   of how to look at things, another door opens and one stands in a different
   landscape before there was time to get a clear picture of the first.  This
   continues several times, until the mundane world interrupts.  This is
   somewhat like the way vision works.  In order to see something the eyes jump
   from detail to detail, the whole scene is a vague impression at any moment.
   </p>

   <p> Every detail is exciting and exploding with potential, just like the
   ordinary world.  One knows that every detail of the mundane world is
   miraculously exciting if it can be seen with fresh eyes.  One sits on the
   ordinary bed, bored, but there are entire universes of complexity within
   small threads of the sheet, the vast mountain ranges of the blankets, the
   atmospherics of the air in the room.  The paintings on the wall, each the
   product of thousands of years of cultural refinement and loss, beyond the
   blinds is an entire planet!  I am reminded (so often!) of the typical story
   of the psychedelic experience where subjectively one is discovering truths
   of such deep profundity that are expressed in words that are obvious, silly,
   or ridiculous to anyone not enraptured by them.  But this is exactly what
   one expects, the kingdom of heaven is everywhere but we cannot see it.  When
   we do see it, it just the ordinary stuff of our lives.  My god the vision is
   overpowering, but then one needs to get a drink, pay the rent, go to work,
   and the vision recedes.
