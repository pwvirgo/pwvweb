<h2>Unfinished letter</h2>

<p>This is a letter I wrote in a 3 ring note pad, but never sent. I
unsure exactly when it was written, mid 1998 is a good guess.</p>

<p>Thankyou for your book "Collision with the Infinite"</p>
<p>
I was meditating on December 27th, 1997 when I disappeared. I have
been reading Krishnamurti, various Buddhists, etc. for years and when
it happened I thought "oh oh oooh IT is happening"!  I was thrilled
and sceptical. There was this clear absence of Phil, I did not know if
it was real or perhaps I might think the "wrong thought" or change my
breath and the "illusion" would crumble.  I was looking around (still
sitting with eyes closed) cautiously to observe the new world without
causing a disturbance. But I found that it was not some fragile state 
- it was an obvious fact that there never was a Phil.
</p>
<p>
I could laugh, cry, run, eat, play with the dog with no Phil! I was
ecstatic!!! I was aware of a great clarity if perception that made
every moment - (words fail) - beautiful, intense, funny, profound,
sad.</p>
<p>
"My" emotions came unglued, I would move from laughing in pure joy
at the sight of the community of plants in an untended field to 
intense crying and a very deep sadness in a matter of secounds. I
"saw"  the amazing energy, intelligence, organization of the universe
(myself - I clearly had the experience of being the univerce).
</p>

<h2>A note in 2009</h2>
<p>
The letter stops there.  I wish I had spent more time, closer to the
events writing down the facts.</p>

<p>This lasted for about a week, and I would find myself thinking
very typical "Phil" thoughts about the nature of the universe. I
would start down a train of thoughts and then notice what was
happening.  Be amused at the way the body/mind was constructed with
programmed actions, I could see "Phil" as a familiar pattern of 
behaviors, but I had no identification that "Phil" was "me", it
was just a familiar pattern. I would look at the train of ideas that
where unfolding and evaluate if there was likely to be anything new
or important happening by continuing to think them, I always decided
not, and then, with no effort, no known strategy or action, I would
sinply stop thinking.  This would happen on long walks with the 
maggie, our dog.  I would be looking at the beautiful night sky
and maybe start thinking about the vastnes of space, the possible
intelligence out in the galaxy, and then decide I'd already explored
those musings and go back to just being there in the universe.
</p>
<p>
At the time I was living in
Middletown, MD with a couple of my children, Stephanie and Joshua. 
They we gone for over a week to spend time with their Mom in
 Annapolis.  I had had a little grass for the first time in years.  I
think it was gone by the time I disappeared while meditating.</p>
<p>
The experence of being the universe lasted for about a week. I had
various personal issues, like and unhappiness with a realationship
with Susan, and an unwillingness to call it off, because I didn't 
want to deal with the emotional tramma.  That situation had been
going on for years, and it was still a dilema even during this time.
</p>
<p>
Stephanie and Joshua came home one evening. And I felt this duty
to be their Dad.  I had no concept of how to talk to them and
tell them that while they had been gone their Dad had disappeared.
In fact he had never really existed in the way one normally thought
of these things.  But his body is still here and we'll find new way
to relate.  It seemed like a farsicle stupid conversation, so as
they came into the house, I some how reinhabited Phil as they
 appeared, and have not been able to return to the direct experience
 of being the universe since that time.  I did not mention it to them
for several years - until they had all left home.</p>

<p>I've had the experience of gathering from the great unknown back
into being "Phil" in a single quick moment 2 times in my life.
  Once as discussed above. The
other time as a tenager I was riding my bike by Chettenago Falls,
standing while pedaling uphill and the chain slipped and I fell and
hit my head on the pavement.  I no longer remembered an specifics
about myself.  Not my name, not my situation, not where I lived,
nor who I knew.  I got back on my bike an rode 3 miles back to my
house, with no plan and I don't think I was verbalizing anything to
myself, I did not know where I was going.  When I got there I knew
 "this is where I live".  I went to
my room, "this is my room", and sat on my bed, with no knowledge 
beyond that this was my room.  I heard some very familiar sounds.
I did not identify them as they where happening, what I experinced
was intense anticipation and excitment that something was coming
 that was going to teach me the truth of my situationbut.  In fact it
was the sound of my parents driving up the dirve, coming in the 
back door, my mother caming up the stairs and down the hall to my
room, as she appeared in the door I knew she was Mom and and knew
everthing again all in an instant in a rush.</p>

<p> Actually that experience of the unknown becoming the known,
the intense excitment and aticipation (felt less intensly and more
and a dulling entrapment when Steph and Josh came home) happened
yet a 3rd time in my life.  As a 21 year old on LSD when God came
down the street, and gathered together from the sky and the ground 
and the people and the animals and became ever more concetrated as
"He" approched. I was thrilled and very much wanted to meet God.
Bit the intesity was becoming unbearable.  The widow flung open
 and banged against the wall although there was no breeze and no
 distrubance other than the appraoch of God.  As "He" was asecnding
 the stairs to our apartment it seemed clear he was a force like the
nuclear core of the Sun, not malevelant but so intence that to meet
"Him" would be to be reduced to subatomic particales blasted across
space.  I (?we?) chickened out "NO!".  and it was over but for the
fear and dissapointment.</p>
