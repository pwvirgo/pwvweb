<h1>Phil Virgo Journal for July 1996</h1>
<h2>July 9,1996</h2>

Yesterday was the first day in over a year that I slept in a bed.  For the past
year I have slept mostly on a small junky piece of foam rubber in a corduroy
sack.

It is a luxury to have a nice queen size bed!  No sheets, and haven't cleaned
the blankets in that time.  Sometimes I sleep out in the back yard and watch
the stars.  Yesterday Janice left for a month living at the dorm at gw law
school, so I get to sleep in the bed.  It is a luxury to have a nice queen size
bed.

Sony Bono senator from CA is talking to the national press club.  How he got
into politics...  He settled in Palm Springs and started a restaurant.  He
wanted to get a sign, and it was the hardest thing he ever did.  He eventually
resolved that the only way to get the sign was to run  for mayor and fire the
person he was dealing with.

Got a new computer at work, a 133 mhz Pentium from Compact, spent the day
setting it up.  Spoke with Pablo and Joshua and Elisabeth.  Pablo is planning
to take a train to Syracuse this weekend to go to a concert with Mat Crup.
Josh could be dropped off at the metro and come here for the weekend.  No one
knows how to locate Janice (who promised she would leave the paid bills on the
computer desk, but instead took them with her, as always.  The Toyota Previa
payment is 20 days behind and we have so little money I don't want to pay 2
times. I have no way to figure out if she has sent a check)

A doctor on the Diane Rheim Show (WAMU radio) is saying that studies show that
prayers are effective in healing.  Controlled studies show that rats that are
prayed for heal faster than the rats that aren't prayed for.  Also people can
pray for rats to heal more slowly -  that also works.  The rat studies are
meant to show that this is not just positive thinking on the part of the
subject. I have a problem with prayer.  Don't know what God is, what I am
praying to.
