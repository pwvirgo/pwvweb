	<h1>pwv remembering an insight into the world</h1>
	
<p>In 1968 I stood alone atop hill over looking the railroad tracks in
Cazenovia.  It was a long very steep slope covered with loose rocks, most of
which where no bigger than my fist. Throwing or dislodging a rock would start a
landslide, a small disturbance could grow into a large amount of material
rushing down hill and spreading out wider and wider as it triggered new
landslides. This was fascinating, and I repeated the procedure many times.
After each event the face of the hill was changed.  I saw the tumbling rocks
being directed by the existing shape and relative stability of hill they
encountered on their path.  Likewise their fall reshaped hill and modified the
relative stability of the terrain as it interacted.  A phrase formed in my mind
- "energy creates form, form directs energy". </p>

<p> The memory of this experment and the synopsis I came to, has stayed with me
for the past 40 years.  Since that time I've read and heard similar conclusions
from others. Although the idea is not uniquely mine, it seemed to me to be a
completely original insight and formulation of something I was discovering at
that moment.</p>
