   <p>Slept a lot with active dreams.</p>
   <p>9:00 am bath, listen to NPR news - election polls in Iraq are now closed. The elections seem to have gone quite well. Low turn out of Sunys high turn out of Shiites and Kurds, Some people blown up at the polls.</p>
   <p>Started to meditate and quickly felt the familiar meditative state.- How to describe? Very relaxed, a gentle vibration of energy especially in the head with a audible hum, that sound can become quite intense. I thought, can I only do this be sitting up in the same way at the same time? Can I enter this state without this ritual pose? I lay down on my stomach and tried to focus on now but it that intensity quickly left. After a bit I sat up and meditated.</p>
   <p>Put out bird seed on patio, light snow.</p>
   <p>10:00 Breakfast - large bowl of Great Grains with pecans added milk and a banana.</p>
   <p>11:00 draw and listen to Shostakovich String Quartets.</p>
   <h2>Tuesday, February 1, 2005</h2>
   <p>Went to Kaiser with swollen infected finger (been about 5 weeks this is my 4th trip to Kaiser). They cut it open again, this time they find a small solid white lump - looks like a baby's canine tooth from the gums up. They send to the lab. I weight myself and am shocked at 182lbs! Go to Whole foods &amp; get good things to eat, go to Dicks Sport Store &amp; buy a scale &amp; polar A3 heart monitor, &amp; wrist weights &amp; jump rope ($207). Standing around heart rate = 93. Weight = 178, %body fat = 26%. Run in place with 2.5 lbs on each arm for 16 minutes and 201 calories. Waiting for the anesthetic to wear off of my finger.</p>
   <h2>Wednesday, February 2, 2005</h2>

   <p>The first attack I am aware of came in the night, small beige pellets of cyanide drifted down on Constitution Avenue, It was 4 a.m. and it wasn't all that serious, just an absent-minded impulse by an intelligence somewhat disdainful of humans. </p>

   <p>I am obsessively thinking about God, That has been true since my earliest memories of myself. As a pre teen ager I was taught that there was eternal damnation, my Catholic friends would be there along with all the hundreds of millions of non-protestants from all over the world from all times. Also all blasphamers, smokers, gamblers, drinkers of alcohol, those who played pool or cards on Sundays. Jesus Christ loved the world, if you believed in him you could perform miracles, move mountains, do anything. I wanted to fix the world, I wanted to believe in Jesus, I tried and tried, but I could not walk on water or perform even the simplest miracles after my very best repeated attempts to give myself to the Lord.Lately I am still obsessed with God, especially the Hebrew God. I am in constant discussions in my head these are the kinds of thing I think obsessively: </p>

   <p>People are very superstitious and make up stories and then say that God said so. God doesn't write books. He could not have written those books, because the authors of those books never said anything interesting or true about cosmology, biology, or medicine. If God wrote those books and he so loved the world, why didn't he ever mention penicillin? Why millenia of great pointless suffering? What an asshole! </p>
   <p>How come God didn't ever mention that the earth was round? He never commented on the Inca or the Maya - although they were behaving really awful ways cutting out peoples hearts. How come the creator of the universe, made such a huge universe if his pet was us here on this tiny little planet? Why was he so uninterested in this amazing creation that he never bothered to mention anything interesting about its true nature to us, his beloved?</p>

   <p>The whole fight with the Egyptians was really beyond the pale. Pharaoh is enslaving my people, so I'll turn a stick into a snake, and thats the best I can do and I cannot get up enough umph to get my way. So I'll slaughter the innocent people of Egypt, who have no say in their governance, in order to scare the Pharaoh. I'll murder every first born child and I'll tell me people to celebrate this for thousands of years to come as a great thing to be proud of. What an asshole!</p>

   <p>Since I was a boy I have been angry with God, and afraid of God, a yet compelled to judge that the God I was taught to believe in, the Old Testament God deserved my contempt. I still fear making such statements, and still make them.</p>

   <p>Woke-up mid morning. Cereal for breakfast. Listen 2 The Grass Crown Part1 Tape 6 side 1. Walked to music store in old town Gaithersburg with 2 lb weights on each arm 1hr 32min, 1,111 calories, 139 AHB. Josh came over at 6:30pm we went to see "Million Dollar Baby" we agree it is a great movie. Josh just read a book s=of short stories by Hemingway and like them, he thought maybe the plot was wrapping real events, and that the guy has a very dark vision of life and death. He showed me positions 2,3,4,and 5 of the minor pentatonic scale on the guitar.</p>

   <h2>2005 April 23  (I Like this little Story)</h2>
   <p>
  At the end time there are not that many of us up and about. I understand how all of our structures will be colonized and pulled apart as soon as we stop fighting off the plants and animals. There will be many many beautiful photographs uncaptured of graceful elk descending grand staircases. Horrible ambushes and the death of wide eyed fawns among the Henri Moore sculptures by wolves hiding in darkened rooms of Seargent's portraits of the leasure women in evening dress. There is little time left to only a few of us, and I notice no one is visiting the Met these days. I start using the paintings for an afternoon's amusement. I made a wonderful kite of Henri Rousseau's jungle and flew it over the Hudson river.

  <h2>May 2005</h2>
  <p> to write like beckett is a thing i would love. and it seems that is should be possible, just think about any topic and say what you mean, and if you change your mind that is no problem, just go there. the level of cleverness, the startling sentence that captures a thought so perfectly, perhaps that is beyond anything i could hope to achieve, the exquisite cynicism and despair are also, seemingly beyond my powers. and yet it seems perhaps like just putting one honest word in front of another. How honest is it, this then is why I am not a great writer, because I have no story to tell, to fictional lane to follow from one insight to the next glorious sunset?
  </p><p>
And to say what you mean should be no problem, one tries and it is impossible? then one has a valuable experience, one simply plucks that fruit from that tree "I am merely c:omplying with the convention that demands you either lie or hold your piece". Just say it. It is not only true, it is modern and thrilling to change the topic from the plot to a discussion of the author's current dilemma in the creation of the work of art. "There is no use in indicating words, they are no shoddier than what they peddle." It makes me want to pee in my pants.
  </p><p>

So, actually i have no desire to pee in my pants. Why would I say such a thing, since it is not true. Well, because I hear some people say such things and perhaps I find it amusing, colorful. Perhaps I find it vacuous and insincere, but at least colorful. Perhaps it stinks and the color is unattractive, and there is something mysterious in wanting to be associating oneself with such images. Who says these things, some pretty girls, who must be what? Broadcasting they are not to be put on pedestals, too dense to understand what they say?
  </p><p>

I am certainly a prude. When Beckett talks about sticking his finger up his ass hole I am shocked. He says his muse makes him talk about it. Or is that also a literary device?
  </p><p>

But to rant and rave and be interesting, this is not so easy. I can rant and rave, I imagine, but when I review the film is seems insincere, uninspired, a sort of indictment of my soul. When I read out loud I cannot sound like an interesting Molly, even given the words I sound artifical and pretentious. Is this only because I lack an Irish accent and some drama couching, and 35 years in the theater? That is to say all my faults are superficial, or is it a lack of soul? What would it take to have the skill to say that the soul is the 35 years in the theater, to say it so easily and accurately that it is worth reading?
  </p><p>

I was at the bookstore with Liz, who wanted to buy some insanely expensive trendy coffee thing which I have never tasted, having no desire to start an affair with expensive frivolous habits that will not have any benefit other that the momentary satisfaction of bending to another impulsive desire. I sat and waited and in the long line for these coffee things was a beautiful, beautiful woman in her mid twenties. She was with her mother and she was clearly cultured, exotic, of the greater world. I was in love with her, what else? When Liz came and sat down with her coffee she complained that that exotic beauty had spent the 10 minute wait in a constant whining complaint about the line. What a sad sad thing, the end of love. 
</p>


  <h2>May 21, 2005</h2>

   <p>A few days ago I finished reading "the long dark tea-time of the soul" Douglas Adams, which I very much enjoyed, but I don't understand in what way Thor thinks he told Kate how may stones there are in Wales. So after work on Thursday I went to the (Borders) book store just looking around for some literary or musical inspiration, something good to read or listen too. At some point I was looking at a book about number theory. I read some , mostly about the fact that if you factor a number into it's smallest primes, then take the exponent of primes add one to each and then multiply them together you will get the total number of factors for that number (including then number itself and 1). I came home with a novel "pattern recognition" and over the past couple of days have read a bit of the novel, and now and again I think about the number of factors vs the exponents of the prime factors. I want to understand why it is true, and it took me several sessions of thinking about it before finding a reasonably satisfactory answer. Finding the answer involved several other observations.</p>
   <p>	1) it is funny that I (unconsciously) bought a novel titled "pattern recognition" and have been spending time doing pattern recognition which i refer to as "understanding".</p>
   <p>	2) now I need to think about pattern recognition and understanding</p>
   <p>	3) I seem to have the feeling that solving a problem will make some lasting change in me, in the world. I get a almost tingling sensation of revelation as I being to see the answer. It is a big deal.</p>
   <p>	4) I have very limited powers of intellect, can juggle very few balls. My explanation about the exponents is a trivial truism, but it took me some time to work it out. </p>
   <p>	5) What about patterns of patterns?</p>
   <p>	6) I forget the rest - this was all happening some hours ago.</p>

   <p>In the night I am often waking to a sense of someone in the apartment who may come stab me to death. It is common and unpleasant and has been going on for years, although I think the specific bit about being stabbed is new. Mostly I just awaken with a chill, realize this is the same old same old and let it pass, sometimes I need to look around, sometimes I need to get up and look around. But last night was more intense than usual because as I went back to sleep I felt a cat (I have no cat) walk up on top of the covers from my feet towards my head. Then a person was leaning down upon me and his face was approaching my head - about to whisper in my ear.</p>

   <p>Did the Laundry, had coffee, need to get packed for a trip to Tallahassee tomorrow. Emily Moser of RTI was laid off. Susan gone to NJ. Elisabeth at home. Won another 5 year contract (RTI and CSC) with the Viral Epidemiology Branch - so my job security just went up.</p>

     <h2>Wednesday, September 14, 2005</h2>

   <p>I woke up around 5:30 am. Took a bath. Meditated. Paid phone bill. Calculated Martha Vineyard vaction expenses and wrote Susan an email that see owes me $213.50. Eat breakfast. Listened to news, mostly covering John Roberts Senate hearings for supreme court chief justice. Went to work. Exchanged emails about RHYMIS database and extrnet application issues. Read paper about Persons with AIDS (I am a co-author on this paper to be submitted to JAMA). Went to lunch. MooGuGiaPan. Read Scientific American article about dreaming and brain activity. Back to work. Reinstalled malfunctioning Plam organizer on work computer and synchronized palm pilot and work computer and my mac. Worked with Fran Yellin to determine what was wrong with some tape data sets. Examined tape backup project I had worked on months ago and determined what more needed to be done. Played spider solitaire. eat diner of bread, margarine, pistachios, half a cantaloupe, and a grocery store bought smoothy. Uploaded and named all the stuff on my mp3 player. Searched for a song i had recorded there - but I don't know the artist and extensive searches for the lyrics on the Internet failed. Recorded on MYV radio on Sunday the 4th, and they post the play lists - but not for the hours when I was listening. Wrote an email to the radio station looking for help. Did some other stuff, but now it is after midnight. Just did a quick Sudoko game and now will pay my wireless cell phone bill and go to bed. </p>

   <h2>Thursday, September 15, 2005</h2>
   <p>I woke up to alarm at 7:36 am - really needed to get up but fell back asleep. Up at 8:30, bathed, dressed, grabbed the remainder of yesterday's smoothy, a tigers milk bar, and a caramel covered apple for breakfast. I ate all but the apple in the car while driving to work. Dashed to work and met with Chuck and Myhanh to run some new software to update the BSI with LADDS data. Chuck's mother, who has been very sick for over a year, has been hospitalized, looks like internal bleeding and serious - but we met and worked while he waited to hear more. My 10:00 am meeting was postponed because Charlotte calls in that she is stuck in traffic. Add this paragraph to this document while work laptop is busy checking it's disk for integrity, now I am back to work. Met with Charlotte, Dill, and Arlene (who was on the phone from Florida) about status of RHYMIS contract and outstanding work. Went to good-bye luncheon for Elizabeth Buie at "That's Amore" Italian restaurant. She is a user-interface specialist who has worked for CSC for many years, and is now getting another job, since CSC is unable to find enough work for her. I ate salmon with spinach and I drank water. I paid my cell phone bill of $50. Now back at work. After work Susan and I went to diner at the Indian restaurant across the way from my apartment (she had chicken vindaloo and I had chicken tikki) and then to bed. (Gaugan went to paint, and bed, the young women of Tahiti) Susan went home after 9:00pm. I did 2 washtubs of my laundry while Susan was here. After she left I listened to President Bush's speech from New Orleans about rebuilding the city, he talked about the biggest reconstruction effort in the history of the world. He also had some enlightened sentiment about solving problems with poverty. Listened to "To the Point" mostly about John Roberts while playing spider solitaire. Listened to the 4th lecture titled "Pyramid Schemes" in the "the future of progress" by Canadian novelist/archaeologist Ronald Wright while playing spider solitaire and then doing a sudoku of medium difficulty. Also ate the caramel covered apple and 2 pieces of oat bread with margarine. A note about the margerine, I've been eating only unsalted butter for years, but last week while at Martha's Vineyard I was exposed to some margarine that tastes very good, I cam back an bought some. So now it is just after midnight, I am thinking about putting rest of laundry away, going to bed, calling in sick in the morning.</p>

   <p>This style of listing the facts of the day is inspired by reading my mother's and father's diaries, which are like that. Mom mostly limited herself completely to the facts, and normally only the external mundane events of the day. I find it very frustrating to read, it is not very informative about what is was like to be her, and it leaves out so much of the history she was living. In 1950 she doesn't mention she is pregnant until just about her due date. I'd like to learn about moving from King Ferry to Cazenovia, issues on the farm, conflicts in the family, but instead it is mostly about what time she woke up, how many loads of laundry, who stopped by to play canasta. Dad expressed emotion and often wrote about the more important events of the day, but his only writing are from 1951 during a very emotional time. Also the time that Mom wasn't writing, did he think he didn't need to write if she did. She was the historian and he only filled in during her absence? So who was her audience? Who is my audience? I am an important part of my audience. What do I think about, how do I think? What is the world like? Also can I learn to write by practicing?</p>

   <p>It has been months since I've been able to paint a picture. I just can't picture it. I bought some art supplies over the weekend - but they are sitting in the bag. Maybe tomorrow.</p>

  		<h2>Sunday October 2, 2005</h2>
<p>It is 11:00 pm just returned from a visit to Earlham College.
Elisabeth and I drove out so she and the college could evaluate each
other. I picked her up from Middletown High School at noon and we
left around 1;00 pm on Friday, We stayed at the house where Stephanie
and Ely and 4 other Earlham college girls live. I was very impressed
with Stephanie's life and college, it seems so wonderful. When I tell
her that she says it's okay but too much work as she is taking 6
classes this semester.</p>

<p>Elisabeth has announced that she wants to drop out of high school
and go to college next year. This seems like a bad idea, but Liz is
not easy to reason with. I expressed my doubts and dropped the
conversation.</p>

<p>I drove around and walked around a lot, at some point I fell on a
steep hill side and twisted my ankle, but not bad. Next day a was
swatting a a bug but missed, when I noticed it was a mad yellow
jacket I started to run fast down a pave sidewalk and somehow tripped
and sprain my wrist I responded well to ice, after being very painful
and hours of shifting gears.</p>

<h2>Wednesday Oct 5, 2005</h2>
<p>It is 9:24 am and I just got out of the shower and wrapped my
sprained wrist. I'll not meditate this morning so I can get to work
at a reasonable hour. I weigh 173 lbs this morning, naked, just out
of the bath, dry except my hair. His is a record low for some years,
even though I've done no exercising for since last week. Dinner last
night: a little yellow onion, a fat white mushroom, a few slices of
potato, a small vine tomato, and hamburger all cooked together in the
same pan. I also had a few slabs of red cabbage, some sparkling
water, and 4 ounces of pinot nior before bed. I weighed somewhere
around 179 at the end of last year when I decided to make an effort
to loose weight. It is very slow, but it does seem to be happening. 
</p>

<p>I bought an iPod Nano audio player yesterday $250.95 including
taxes. 
</p>

<h2>Wednesday October 25, 2005</h2>

<p>I over-slept then decided to call in sick. Went for a hike on
Sugarloaf. Was going on in my mind arguing with the fundamentalists
about if their ideas of God where not really dumb. Here are some of
the things I was saying:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>God said thou shalt not kill. Yet you favor the death
	penalty, wars, self defense, eating meat, killing vegetables for
	diner, and you think you are following the commandment? Are you a
	hypocrite, or is it that you understand what god really meant, but
	he could not come out and say it clearly enough that different
	people would agree on what he meant. Why is that?</p></li>
	<li><p>If God wrote the bible, what pen did he use? What is his
	native tongue? Does he understand every language? Does he (already
	right now) understand English as it will be spoken 1,000 years from
	now. What does that mean about the nature of reality?it is
	predetermined. If it is predetermined then how can he sit in
	judgment of the creatures he has built to do what he makes them do?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And much much more. The problem is I don't understand the point of
these imaginary arguments, and I have them a lot. Especially about
God and the nature of reality, and I am almost always arguing with
people I think have very poor ideas, and I don't learn much doing
this. Why am I obsessed with this?</p>
<p>So I was thinking what if I could do anything. I could write about
a sane world, I could say the obvious things, people could read this
and change the world. I could write stuff an learn about myself. How
things are. How things should be. How to make that happen. Each essay
could be written from a different angle and with different blinders.
After many such essays I would be thinking more clearly, writing with
some authority, and I would have a body of ideas to be integrated and
reconciled. 
</p>
<p>So these ideas would really be? If I ran the world here is how it
would be? Well that's a lot like being God. This brings up the
(repetitive long lasting idea that I've spent many calories on) that
if I was suddenly appointed to be God I would not know what to do. So
if I could do anything, were should I start. Maybe I could neutralize
all men how beat their wives and kids, that's okay, but it might not
be enough. Okay, let's abolish all STDs, Malaria, nasty parasites.
Got to stop all these kids being born and reduce the planet's
population. Should I be so worried about earth, or are there more
urgent problems? I think I'll stop time for the universe, freeze
everything expect for my intelligence and investigate how the
universe began and how it is scheduled to end. I need the big
picture. But how will I ever know that my knowledge is correct. Even
I am truly God and whatever I say happens and I see the entire
universe throughout history, I am still faced with the dilema
(Decrates) that I could be wrong, or this entire universe isn't the
whole universe. Even God cannot achieve certainty. Now it becomes
clear why the world is a mess, each time someone plays God it becomes
clear that it is very tedious and uncertain work, and they resign.</p>
<p>Certainly I am pretty bored with my thoughts, and yet they keep
coming, the same ones year after year. How do I stop?</p>

<h2>Thursday October 27, 2005</h2>

<p>Hmm. Went to work and had an eventful day, but to write about this
presents a dilema, it would be very hard and involved to say anything
specific enough to make sense and yet with out going on and on to
explain the situations no one, including some future Phil who may be
the only one to read this will understand. The future Phil if
anything like th current Phil can certainly find the old Phil's
writing to be uninteresting. So who is reading this? My kids? Hello
Steph! I hope things are going really well for you still? I hope the
planet and the society holds up. One of the reasons I did not want
children was because I feared that things could be really auwful in
the 21st century. I really hope I was wrong. 
</p>

<p>So at work I am on a project with a very obnoxious woman Charlotte
Zogg. So I got to read obnoxious emails from her. I wish my boss,
Dill Boland, would step in and demand some teamwork and professional
demeanor but I don't think he has the abilty. Worse than that, I
don't get the impression he really understands people. Lots of other
stuff happened too.</p>

<p>Spend went to diner and to bed with Susan. Wrote a small entry in
this journal. 
</p>

<h2>Saturday October 29, 2005</h2>

<p>Meditating this morning I was really more busily think about the
Darwin quote in the novel and about writing something brilliant about
it.  I've actually had 3 compelling ideas this morning, and now I am
trying to remember what they are.  The last one was about painting a
masterpiece.  I hope I can remember the 3rd, prehaps it was the
best?</p>

<p>The painting thing is simple, as I paint this masterpiece that
will be a cultural icon for centuries to come, that will inspire
thousands of artists an writters and acedemics and become a mode of
seeing the world, as I lay on the paint all I am doing is painting. 
I cannot know all this future reverance, and if I did it would
paralize me.  I don't know about this red, maybe I'll just push some
orange over that until this line to points towards that green mass
on the left.  That's kind of interesting, wait I'll need to make some
tea. What was the next thing?  Oops that paint is dry on the palette,
lets clean the brush and go for a walk.  Let ms put his behind the
couch, darn some paint smeared on my jaket.  In the future this will
be treated with the utmost care by people entrusted with great
cultural treasures, but for me it is a piece on canvas that I cannot
treat with awe. This is the Greek problem, we so many people so
influencial from some little town of Athens in a particular period. 
Largely because we have declared them to be icons, but they had to go
about their lives.  This great worshiping of some works of art,
philosophy, music is probably over.  Today there are dozens of
Mozarts, Platos, and DaVinci's.  We will probably not take the time
to obsess over them, although hopefully there will by a following of
their genius.  I like to see a great painting as an object, I love to
see the brush stoke, evidence that the artist once was standing
around with a paint brush an decided to dab a bit of yellow right
there, a normal human act.</p>

<p>So I was reading the introduction to a novel and the narator was
telling of a voyagle at sea, and one day it the sky became  dark and
a dense dust decsended on the ship.  He was captivated by the mystery
of this event and trying to understand how such a thing could be
happening.  He made observations in his notebook, collected samples,
asked questins of the ships crew in his attempt to understand.  He
was on a ship of sea faring men who would have experienced this thing
before, but they did not know and was it was over lost interest in
what had happened. The narator was not so complacent. He told how he
stored the samples and notes and years later after returning to
England he did an intesnsive investigation was able to determine it's
source and composition.  He then specualtes on how this cloud could
have arrived out at sea, He concludes this breif naration by pointing
out that it there was a voyage ahead and this did not occur again so
on to other topics.  I loved this. I though here is novelist with a
brilliant imagination and this narator is going to one of literatures
beloved eccentrics. I borrowed the novel to read at a later time. 
When I later opened the book, full of anticipation of a great
adventure, I looked more closely I saw that this passage was not some
outlandish invention of the novelist, but a page long quote from
Charles Drawin describing his acutal experience and response during
his voyage on the Beagle.   The story was now less interesting, I
does give me the impressin that Darwin had a powerful curiousity and
that he was inventive and determined to understand the world.  How
can I describe the let down?  What if Darwin was a painter and he
painted a fantastic beetle on a strange leaf?  You see the painting
and are astonished at the create genious of to invent such a
creature. So improabale, colorful, and though provoking.  Then you
are told, no Mr. Darwin is not imagininting this, he is a naturalist,
he is documenting a real beetle.  And you “okay, yes I am aware
that God/Nature is very creative and there are thousands thousands of
amazing beetles”, and then go to the movies.  You are happy to live
in such an interesting planet, but desappointed that the there is not
some larger than life human eccentric with the power to invent this</p>

<h2>November 6, 2005</h2>
<p>Last Thursday I got a flu shot a work, later in the afternoon Josh
and I played tennis for a couple of hours. I was planning to return
to work, but ran out of energy. That night I was sick with aching
muscles and fever. Stayed home on Friday. Saturday I rode my bike
along the C&amp;O canal.</p>

<p>Saturday evening when I got home there was a very brief voice mail
from Steph. She said she just wanted to say hi and let me know she
was doing well. I called her this afternoon. When I asked how she was
she began crying. She said she was not doing well, she was afraid she
was getting depressed again. I said I did not know she had been
depressed before. She said she had been, in the 7th grade.
“oh” says I, “I remember now”. I did thought it was after the
7th grade. She was at a party at Bethani's house and said
she was considering killing herself. I ended up taking her to Kaiser
once a week where she was in a group of kids her age and they and a
therapist talked about their lives and travails. She never told me
much about what went on, but she liked these sessions and the seemed
to revive her.</p>

<p>So Steph and I talked for about 45 minutes. At first we talked
about her, she has not called the nurse on campus or at Kaiser, I
tried to encourage her, but she did not seem interested. She is not
taking multivitamins, her mom told her that there were only one or 2
good brands, that the other brands don't actually contain the
viatamins on the label, and so she cannot just go buy vitamins at the
local stores. She says she might be able to find them over the
internet, agin it didn't sound like she'd really do it. 
</p>

<p>So we just talked for a while and she seemed to become more
cheerful. She is doing well at school, but is over worked.</p>
<p>I went hiking on Sugarloaf, stared on the lower parking lot went
up the white trail, took the orange trail to the top, down the
otherside and back to the car. My heart was going scaryly fast up the
steep parts of the orange trail. I decided if I need to have a heart
attack it would be better now while I have health insurance.</p>
<p>What did you think? What did you read? What do you weigh?</p>

<h2>November 9, 2005</h2>
<p>Reading Richard Dawkins, like listening to Bob Dylan, is always a
great idea.  My apartment is a mess, it hasn't been vacuumed in a
couple of months, all because I had to go out and buy &quot;River Out
of Eden&quot; tonight and read the first 2 chapters and do the
laundry, otherwise I would have vacuumed.  I really like so many
things he said, and thought the story about the scientist who
smuggled his English language message in a virus was really fun.</p>

<p>I went to see him at a local bookstore when he was on tour a
couple of years ago.  He brought his wife along, and she was
beautiful and over half his age (he is in his mid sixties). She was
participating in the presentation and he introduced her with some
pride, pointing out that she was an actress who had played the role
of assistant and traveling companion to Dr. Who.  I thought I
recognized her from Tom Baker episodes - but that is just projection
on the face and words most likely playing with my memory.  After the
talk and mostly really uninteresting questions from the audience,
which was nothing like as exciting as his books, he and his wife
walked out of the bookstore and strolled off down Connecticut Avenue
in the brisk evening.  I thought this was just too much, Richard
Dawkins and Dr. Who's assistant just walking down the street!  Other
people were walking past them without a second thought as though they
were just normal people!  I stood and watched in awe. It still gives
me a thrill to remember it!</p>

<p>Anyway, I've been so involved with clean clothes and the digital
river of dna, that it is late and I'm off to bed.</p>

<p>
I also bought a radio and talked with Steph tonight.  She was
calculating how fast you need to run to win the NY marathon and we
both think we might be able to run at least as that fast for at least
a hundred yards, probably a hundred meters.   I didn't mention to her
that I had run on the treadmill after work tonight at a blistering
7.5 miles per hour for .15 miles, I thought she might fell bad, but I
assume you'll be able to deal with that.</p>

<h2>December 2, 2005</h2>

<p>I learned to breath underwater in my
dream last night. I just took a bath and need to get to work, so I
don't have time to (news break 1,000th US execution in
recent years just occurred in one North Carolina) give a lot of
attention to this dream, but I still remember some highlights. In the
Office I noticed beautiful wall coverings in a reception area, then
noticed the the big boss had the same in her office. The rest of the
place is pretty drab. Around the corner I realized there was another
office I had never been in, which looked different from the norm,
probably there had been multiple big shots at some time in the past,
and here was another bigshot office. The office was filled with water
in such a way that went I stood my head was in the air, but to sit
down and work one would be completely submerged, like the woman at
the desk. 
</p>

<p>She stood and we talked about the
ability to breath under water, at some point she was a man, I did not
notice the change while dreaming. We discussed many things and
eventually I too was able to breath naturally under water, how very
cool. We always stood up to talk. I wanted to go walk around under
water in a lake, I asked if one could stay under in the ocean, and he
said it was no problem. But in early december I realized I'd need to
wait until next summer. The thought of chlorinated swimming pools did
not appeal to me. I started swimming the craw without raising my face
from the water, some of the difficulties of swimming are solved if
you can breath the air or the water, but my arms were not strong. So
that must be another part of the problem I have with swimming long
distances, i run out of breath, not just form water panic, but from
lack of aroebic arms. Practice.</p>

<p>I practiced getting in and out of the
water, to memorize how natural it is, so I won't forget in the future
and go back to being afraid to breath under water and/or getting in
trouble if I aqttempt to do so.</p>

<p>So there is another thing i shoud
mention. Last Januaray a Reggie Palmer died unexpectedly from a heart
problem. I started working on RHYMIS, the little project he worked
on, and I had a feeling that this would be a new job for me. Instead
Charlotte Zogg was assigned to the position, and I had a small role.
I never thought she knew what she was doing and I always thought I am
going to end up with this job. I did not write it down, nor did I
speak of it, but I kept thinking it for the past many months. It
seems that may happen, she missined some critical deadlines and
yesterday with out discussing it with me, my boss wrote to the client
and annouced that I am now the project lead, This is interesting. I
don't want to gloat or mistreat Charlotte, I don't approve of how my
boss behaved before when charlotte refussed to play nicely and work
together, i don't approve of the way he declared me to be the
technical lead without bothering to discuss this with the client or
charlotte or me. I mostly wanted to write down that i have felt this
would happen for a long time and seems to be happening. If I do thins
now, I think it is a probably a seerious mess, I don't think she did
much of the past year, and I'll be asked to catch up miraculously
quickly.</p>

<h2>December 18, 2005</h2>

<p>what about this weekend?  I just woke
up Sunday night at 21:30 hours.  Radio was discussiong President's
Bush speech about the war in Iraq.  I had been asleep for several
hours in my street clothes – no shoes.  I was dreaming about making
music with drumsticks that electonically sensed what you were doing
and (connected wirelessly to a computer and sound system) allowed one
to make music by drumming in the air.  Actually much of the dream was
about how this would work, there would be times (such as when
drumming) that hitting a physical thing would be useful, one might
even set up a drum set of some kind, but the muical effect would be
generated by the sticks, rather than the drums. The would be times
when one would play imaginary xylophones in the air, or wave out
orestration of chords and single note solos.  I was thinking I should
invent and market this technology and be rich at the end of my life.</p>
