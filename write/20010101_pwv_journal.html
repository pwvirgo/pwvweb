<h2>Wednesday, June 13, 2001, 9:15 PM</h2>

<p>I am reading “Inner Revolution”  Robert Thurman.</p>

<p>The Buddha tells us there is no self.  There is nothing permanent. Richard
Dawkins tells us that it is the genes that are evolving not the species, nor
the individuals.  Neuroscience tells us that our experience of the world is
dependent on scores of separate brain modules each quite unconsciously
concerned with some small task. (The generation of consciousness is thought to
be the result of these mindless brain modules). History tells us that our most
cherished ideas and our world view are a product of this time and place, we can
be sure that they will not be available nor desirable in the future or the
past.  The earth sciences tell us that the land masses, climate, oceans are all
in flux.  Biology tells us that our species and ecology are fleeting. Astronomy
tells us that our planet is not permanent.</p>

<p>I seem to be an awareness generated by a pattern of swirling energy.  Energy
swirls and patterns emerge, then patterns of patterns, then patterns that
sustain themselves, then communities of patterns begin to emerge.  Now patterns
of communities these communities are forming and are beginning of another
hierarchy of process.  So forces and particles form atoms, mocules, clouds,
galaxies, stars, trees, oceans, currents, land masses, societies, economes,
stock markets, business cycles, brains, minds.</p>

<p> So I am a mind.  That is the level at which I exist.  With this mind I
perceive galaxies, deseases, feet, lovers, hatred, profits,m and empty space.
</p><p>
“I” am (“you” are) but a  a) point of reference; b) illusion; c)</p>
<p>
And yet we are obsessed with “me”.  My drinking, my smoking, my sex life, my
country, my children, my status, my self-esteem, my health, my fun, my
vacation, my wealth, my pain, my death, my laughter, my joy.  Is this a
biological imperative? A cultural artifact?  It seems as though the Buddha is
correct that it is a recipe for fear, aggression, suffering.</p>

<p>The individual has no substance, no permanence, is in some ways a vessel
being used by the genes, the culture, the family, the memes for their own
purposes.  Yet the individual is the repository of consciousness, the only
experiencer, the only source of value, good/evil joy/terror?</p>

<p>Am I the only experiencer?  Is it sure that the society has no awareness?
The universe creates me but only I have any knowledge that there is a universe?
Without me there is no universe?</p>

	This is an attempt to record the events of the past 3 hours. There is
	nothing to recommend these 3 hours as being of any importance to
	anyone. The account fails to capture the depth, texture, sensation of
	anything. It is a list, the reality was life.</p>

	<p>
	Asleep, I dream of the practice revolution. I am shooting the drivers
	of horse drawn carriages in order to demonstrate my marksmanship to
	myself. I imagine that I am doing this in some noble revolution and
	having an important effect because of my considerable skills. I shoot
	men and women, but not horses - as this seems inhumane. A military
	force arrives. I meet 2 sharp shooters and demonstrate my superior
	abilities with a rifle by shooting my lead balls into the barrels of
	their flintlock rifles when they point them at me. I then announce that
	they should be still while I shoot off their hats.. .</p>

	<p>
	Susan or Leslie and I are attacked by a rabid dark gray cat. We gather
	sticks to defend ourselves from and kill the cat. We hunt the cat, and
	are hunted by the cat around a very large concrete fountain in the
	woods. Finally I am able to confront and should be able to kill the
	cat, but my sticks are too flimsy, and I can not deliver any serious
	force. Go to get more substantial sticks. I meet Mcgregor and Gary
	(army friends from years ago) we are talking as we walk back to get the
	cat, I don't remember the topic.</p>

<p>Wake up and pee - other activities I don't recall</p>

<p>
The idea of complexity evolving from simplicity, the simplicity of a hand full
of physical laws and a big bang. Can the hierarchy of evolving complexity be
listed in order of dependencies? Imagine a universe with 1 pound balls as the
fundamental particles, a big bang, the only force in the universe is kinetic
energy that keeps them expanding. Not very interesting, hard to image
intelligence consciousness arising. It is hard to even argue for the existence
of such a universe absent any witnesses - and they don't seem to be able to
evolve within the universe. What about the being that started it. God creating
universes out of curiosity.  "This one works really well! Look", thinks God,
"an intelligent being that evolved within this universe is imagining the God
that created this universe, a pretty cool trick"! Quite interesting for the
curious god. How does God perceive the complex relationships between the exact
mixture of fundamental particles, forces, ratios, dimensions that where used
and the event of me sitting in bed thinking about God 12.2324564312 billion
years into the process? Presumably everything is simultaneous - God did not
stir up a recipe and wait a for few billion years.</p>

<p>
Bird on the window sill. The esthetics of the window area with the long thin
line of tree leaves outlined by the blinds that are only about 4 inches from
the bottom of the window. The interesting vertical lines of the table legs, the
floor lamp, and the desk. The interesting shape of the upside down black
plastic storage device. The horizontal lines of the blinds. I could decorate
the storage bin, make it from steel, put beautiful murals inside. Keep my
computer there as though it was a beautiful house. Would the computer
appreciate this? A dove appears on the window sill and paces. Could this add
enough interest to this spectacular scene to make an interesting photo, can I
get my camera without scaring the bird away? Watch the bird for some time. Is
the bird attempting to determine if I am another animal watching it? Flies
away.</p>

<p>
I feel my breath and the sensation of fatigue in my legs. Sit up to determine
who am I? For thousands of years people have claimed that consciousness is the
mystery and the answer. Better catch a glimpse of how it works first hand. Who
am I? This experience is radically different from the stress at work, from
being lonely, from unhappy feelings because of inadequacy or social failure.
Different from being obsessed with needing to buy something.</p>

<p>
Ants. The individuals are pre-programmed for certain behaviors like small
unintelligent unaware robots. These actions collectively leading to a coherent
colony with behaviors at least a complex as the individual members and in a way
more meaningful (survival, reproduction, growth, war, peace). Is the colony
awake and alert? The contrast with an idea that human society is this complex
process forming the individual, but that awareness and experience occur at only
to the individual. The culture contains the complexity the direction, and the
knowledge but is thought to be unfeeling and unaware. Opposite of the ant,
where individual gives rise to society and that is were the action is?</p>

<p>
The brain as the source of consciousness, which is possible because of memory,
feedback loops, interaction with the outside world. Thus is true of complex
systems at all levels of existence. Clouds of cosmic dust, the color and the
beauty. And even if the colors are computer enhancements, they are enhancements
of real features in other dimensions.</p>

<p>
The universe is an idea I have been taught!!!The planets circling the sun, the
solr system located in the galaxy, the vast power and emptiness of space and
energy. I can visualize all these but there is no direct experience. The only
experience (of the vast expanse of space) is of dots of light in the sky and I
know very little about those, although I can guess that maybe that reddish one
is mars? Yet this universe is VERY real to me, I believe in it. It is patterns
of words in books I have read, scenes from movies, mechanical models of the
solar system from school, equations of Newton and Einstein, photo graphs form
the Hubble telescope, theories about the tremendous quantum energy intrinsic to
space itself. All of this is memory stored by the culture. It becomes my
reality with no personal experience of the thing in itself. I could never
experience the planets circling the sun - the solar system is a vast emptiness
with planets too small to detect on that scale, and the procession is so slow
to make a single revolution perceivable. It occurs such fantastically
un-experiencible speeds. I have no capacity of experiencing any of it because
of problems with the scales of time and space. Yet I do experience it all very
happily and with tremendous reality in the theater of my mind. I periodically
adjust the stage settings and action sequences based on the latest round of
research that has come to my attention. The idea that empty space is the source
of most of the energy in the universe is really spectacular! Virtual particles
materializing and annihilating each other in such a prolific frantic whirl of
activity should be enough to keep the mind busy for ever more.</p>

<p>
I once was on a mountain in Virginia or West Virginia with a view across a
valley to another mountain, and more mountains visible across the next valley
etc. The sun was setting and I saw the earth turning. I had never seen that
before, but adding my knowledge to my senses gave me a new and very exciting
experience. Once, in Dewitt, I sat on the lawn and looked across space to
distant tress, valleys, hills and experienced them as vast space and
relationships in my mind. This is hard to verbalize but it was the first time I
remember experiencing hundreds of cubic miles of air and light and earth as
being in my mind. Like the earth turning experience, this was a combination of
sensation and theory that led to a profound experience.</p>

<p>
Color itself can be rich and meaningful. The glorious experience of that red in
my painting. The beauty of Van Gogh's color combinations - only in the mind.
What intrinsic value can red have?</p>

<p>
My mind is wandering, and so I am not discovering who am I and unraveling the
mysteries of consciousness. The wanderings capture my attention. Maybe I'll
turn the tables and capture the wanderings. Where is my computer?</p>

<p>An upsetting dream, recorded about 6 hours later.</p>

<p>
I am on DeRuyter Lake in a dilapidated unpainted gray small wooden row boat.
There are oars, but I use a canoe paddle.  I am noticing that I am not sinking
and that I can move the boat with the paddle when I come, unexpectedly, to the
south end of the lake.</p>

<p>
I am exploring inside of houses.  Going from room to room, hoping not to run
into the residents or fierce dogs.  I travel south by entering each house from
the north and leave from the south.  I have forgotten most of this journey.</p>

<p>
(In the external world it is shortly after 3:00 am and the radio beside my bed
is playing international news on npr). </p>

<p>
I find myself in a dark unpleasant scary land which is the southern state of
Bulgaria.  I am in a large rundown drab old house with big high ceiling rooms
that are largely empty.  The cupboards are mostly empty, but occasionally I
come across sleeping people on the floor.  I want to get out and don't
understand why I got myself in this threatening situation.  I do encounter at
least one man….</p>

<p>
Outside it is dusk.  This is a dark and depressing urban area.  There are
strange dark dirty buildings.  Fires.  A giant smokestack spewing great rivers
of dense gray brown smoke into the gray brown sky.  I am in a concrete building
lost in a maze of burning hot pipes running in every direction and dimension.
A ship arrives and captures another man lost like me.  He is going to prison
for 35 years for being lost in this building.  I move on but can find no escape
from the maze.</p>

<p>
I emerge back to the dreadful city, there are many surreal sites including
suburbs of dark filthy little octagonal houses, all the streets are empty there
are no lights in any window, and yet it seems like people really must live
here.</p>

<p>
I forget most of the dream.  I woke up turned off the radio, assumed that it
effected the dream.   I think I have repeated the dream theme of traveling by
means of moving through other peoples houses and yards before.  Also the theme
of going traveling south from DeRuyuter to strange lands is a (separate)
repeating dream theme.  (This seems like an obvious connection to my history,
the time I rode south to Washington, DC on my motor cycle, the experience of
adventure was very intense).</p>

<p>
I have a very strong feeling that I am wasting my life and that it is almost
all wasted.  There are projects a work that are not progressing.  "Who" inside
of me has set itself up as this critic?  All of this is mind.  Why is the mind
putting this interpretation on things? Is it "true"?  Should I make this
unhappy feeling go away by a) willing my self to figure out how to change my
life and then willing myself to follow that plan? B) understand the nature and
relative nature of mind and deal directly with the perception. Emmerse myself
in the feeling and see if it takes me somewhere?</p>

<h1>Afganistan Novmeber 2001</h1>

<h2> My First post on internet site</h2>
<p>
I am reading this forum by accident.  Weeks ago I was feeling completely
isolated in my outrage at the attacks on America as well as our president's
rhetorical jump to war and crusades.  Everywhere around me people said "nuke
Afghanistan", I spoke out now and again that I thought killing the innocent was
not a solution to anything.  (I would hear a variation of "maybe not, but it
feels so good" - I think this is actually an honest statement - I have not a
hint of such feelings).   I was very insecure, inarticulate, and ineffective at
communication.  American Flags that where mostly meant as symbols of solidarity
seemed to me to be symbols of nationalism and the willingness to kill others.
I was a little crazy with visions of bombs and death and a war of
civilizations, religions, fanatics that could be so destructive.  I spent a
weekend alone in the woods and had to use rational thought to determine that I
couldn't be the only person in favor of life and justice, that I am just a
product of my culture, there must be millions like me.  I heard a show about
the Media response on NPR and someone mentioned www.fair.org, and
www.alternet.org so here I am reading this forum.  I am thrilled to find it!
Thanks to you all for creating this discussion, to me it seems like a sign of
hope that we need not descend back to the dark ages.</p>

<h2>Bombs and God</h2>
<p>
My thanks to Cindy, Jennifer, and Stephen for your "welcome" messages.  I have
taken to reading these posts most days.  I seem to discern a great depth of
thought and commitment occurring here.  I have followed many of the topics and
several of the links to other sites.  I had never before read Noam Chomsky on
political matters and find him enlightening.  I don't have the energy to take
on the alternatives to capitalism discussed by Firebrand and Larry, but it
probably is dreadfully important to have an alternative ideal to promote in
concrete ways rather than a general unhappiness and disgust with the world as
created by corporate self interest.  Shawn and others have mentioned public
financing of elections - that would be a real concrete step that might improve
the world!</p>

<p>I feel obliged to post a thought, but I have no clear message, so I ramble briefly</p>

<p>
I don't know how to make sense of what is happening.  Every time I hear Bush or
Rumsfeld I have a visceral reaction that these people should not be in charge.
The man who spoke about crusades has not been transformed into a reassuring
leader in my mind.  I think "we" are largely emoting with bombs.  On the other
hand his rhetoric is improving, and there may be hope in that.  I think that
our founding fathers had a lot of pretty words to wrap their unjust actions in
and somehow those words have actually had the power to move the world.  "All
men are created equal" - that hypocrisy eventually paid off and we begin to
approach that in this country!</p>

<p>
My ideals are deeply offended by the specter of the filthy rich exploiting the
deadly poor.   The greatest most powerful democracy in the history of the world
supporting cruel despotic regimes if it furthers our prosperity.  I am 51 years
old and I have known about this since I was a teenager, but I don't see that
knowledge does a damn bit of good - Americans are not going to attain
enlightenment and elect a humane government!  Self-interest is all that
organisms, persons, or countries can engage in over sustained time frames.
Darwin/Dawkins have made that mathematically clear.  Before people came along
the planet itself was already organized along these lines.  Imagine being an
enlightened antelope wishing to live a just life free of the good-damn lions -
it is an IMPOSSIBLE dream on planet earth!!!!  Imagine being an enlightened
lion trying to figure out how to reform your community!  Because we can
articulate the dilemma is no evidence that we can actually do anything about
it.</p>

<p>
Athena points out the problem of religion in this.  I love all the open minded
talk about respecting each other's religions, but I think perhaps religion is a
net drag on our ability to think clearly and honestly.  It means a lot to point
out how evil the 9/11 events were, but the idea of "evil" is not so good.  Bush
and Bin Laden both think they know evil when they see it, and they both
sincerely want to purify the world.   I strongly disapprove of mass murder, but
it is just a self serving opinion with no absolute justification… I do not
offer my personal knowledge of God as my proof.</p>

Went to work today.  Not very productive at work, helped Frances set up her PC.
Did not offer Michael a ride home an drove by as he waited in the freezing
weather for the bus.  There was a fatal car crash at Clopper Rd and First
Field.  All roads into Orchard Pond Apartments were closed.  Parked at
Supermarket and walked home.  "Life is like a broken radio, there are no good
songs" Salmane Rushdie, "The Ground beneath her feet".</p>

<h1>Saturday, December 29, 2001</h1>

<p>
Dreaming: Susan and I are walking (home?) sometimes it seems we are walking
down Lincklaen Street, other times it is a city.  At some point we are going
past Cazenovia College and I am having fun gliding along a few inches above the
ground, slalom skiing all over the wide space of grass as S walks down the
sidewalk. She tells me that I cut right in front of the woman who stepped aside
to avoid a collision.  I did not know that.  The woman walks down the sidewalk
at a brisk pace and would pass us, but I fly faster down the hill, and S walks
faster to keep up.  I am flying just at the height of the 3" grass and want to
fly a foot or two higher, but cannot seem to increase my altitude.  S talks to
the woman, and returns saying that "she is pretty angry, fortunately she didn't
attack me".  I protest that if she is so angry it is her problem.  If she
needed to take a couple of extra steps because of me, it seems like no big
deal.</p>

<p>Awake:</p>
<p>
I wake up and think that I have not been sailing along off the ground much
lately, then I puzzle as to whether my gliding above the ground only occurs in
dreams.  It seems that it is only in dreams!   But if one thinks about gravity
it does seem that I must not "really" do this when awake.  This is interesting
and sad.  I also ski down carpeted stairs (with my feet touching the edge of
each step) - is that also a dream only experience, or not?  I am still not sure
about that, I haven't done it lately, it sounds dangerous.  Another
observation, it seems I used to fly though the 3 dimensions of the sky rather
than just glide above the ground.</p>

<p>
Yesterday my children came by and we had a fun day.  Exchanging gifts,
listening to music, buying Stephanie a Djembe from Ghana (African Drum).  Josh
left at 8:30pm, then Pab and Steph and Liz and I went to see "The Fellowship of
the Ring".</p>
