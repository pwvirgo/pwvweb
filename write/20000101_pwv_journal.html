I had my car tuned-up.  That was supposed to cost about $400, but ended up
costing  $826.  The cashier took my credit card and charged me $7,158.26.  I
objected, and she reversed the transaction telling me not to worry  about  the
7 thousand dollars.  I went home somewhat worried and attempted to log on to
the internet in order to check my credit card status.  Strangely, my internet
account did not work - "invalid account" was the message.  I attempted to call
my internet provider.  Unhappily, the telephone was dead.  At the store I found
a new battery for my phone, but it needed to be charged for 12 hours before I
could use it.  I  bought a telephone.  After a long story (that is a different
story), I got my internet account reinstated, but I had to wait until the next
day before I would be able to log on.  I was in the bath tub when the telephone
rang. It was the security department of my credit card provider.  I  ran in to
the kitchen to pick up the phone, and fell on my fanny when my wet feet hit the
linoleum floor.  As I cruised naked across the kitchen floor on my back I
crashed into the dishwasher and the stove and cut and bruised my right foot.
The bath water and blood mingled on the floor while I explained the situation
to the credit card representative. She assured me that everything will be
straightened out within 10 days.  At that time I will have the right to call
them back and protest the penalty charges they will assess since I overextended
my account.  I went to the shelf to get some band aids and ... NO PROBLEM!  I
patched my foot (and brushed my teeth) and went to bed. The car seems fine.

<h3>Is there a world without consciousness?</h3>

<p>What I have often wondered is what is the world, universe without
consciousness?  Does that have any meaning?  I can imagine planets, oceans,
hydrogen gas clouds in space with no one there to know about them. But what is
left if you remove me from the equation?  That would be a world that no one is
imaging or experiencing!  There is zero evidence for it’s existence.  How can
we say that something that cannot be experienced or imagined exists?
</p>
<p>
The modern scientific view of the world postulates the existence of such a
world.  We talk about the state of affairs 3 seconds after the Big Bang.  It
will be at least several million and more likely several billion years before
anything like a conscious being  could be postulated to evolve.  What about
Ocums razor?  Is it a simpler construction to project the laws of physics
backward in time for a few billion years of unexperienceable billions of cubic
light years, or is simpler to say here is how it was when we awoke - reality
seems to have appeared with x y z properties at that time?
