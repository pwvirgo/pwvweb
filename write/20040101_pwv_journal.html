   <p>Source NPR All Things Considered June 22, 2204. In Pakistan it is capital offense to be blasphemous. Although the government has not executed anyone on this vaguely worded law - they do arrest people, and people are killed by vigilante citizens (including the police). Know one is brave enough to change this popular law. They go into a case of a man who was beaten and arrested and killed in is hospital bed for leaning a bundle of used new papers against a mosque.</p>

   <p>Time and space, from the outside or from embedded into them - being vs
   becoming. If I can reach a timeless state then perhaps I can meet myself
   there at other times in my life when I have been in a timeless state. I
   could have a meeting place of many selves at various points in my life, (the
   day at the house - the thunderstorm, today, etc). Why would it be only me,
   perhaps being outside of time and space I would also be outside of my
   identity as Phil and there would be a community there. Carl Sagan's story
   about meeting a community of intelligences about the universe - and being
   unable to tell if it is so, or a dream. Why would it be a dream? They spent
   billions and great energy to make it happen and then when it happened - why
   would they doubt it? Because the machinery to escape time was so complex and
   built on faith in the instructions rather than on understanding how it
   worked. How did C. Sagan the writer invoke such a machine, grand and complex
   and give it enough detail to make it seem real rather than just the idea of
   being too big and complicated to understand (that's how it would be for me -
   I would have the idea, but not the knack to wrap in a good story to make it
   live for others), the knack of the story teller. The complexity of that
   machine is analogous to brain - can I use my brain to escape time? If I do
   will it only be a dream? The brain as a chemical electrical network
   operating by means of impersonal unconscious physical forces, can the
   subjective products of this process have a meaning other that the actual
   physics of the thing? Can physical processes create a process that escapes
   time and space? I really should be meditating, here is my breath. So I
   should probably call Susan and be sure she is okay. What if she wants to do
   something today? I could offer to take her to a museum, something I like to
do, if she wants to spend time with me, then spend time with me, in my
   element. Is that too selfish? Anyway, I need to try and make her feel
   better, but does that just prolong this mismatch of a relationship. Well
   either end the relationship or live it with compassion and completeness. Who
   is giving these directives? Who is the voice telling me what to do? The
   voice gets very small and recedes to nothing. I am breathing. These thoughts
   are not important they are within time and space (and I am trying to leave
   time and space - who's directive it that? Never mind, pay attention). I am
   breathing, breathing, breathing. Maybe I should take Elisabeth to NY this
   weekend, is that possible. I don't pick her up until evening, she may be
   going to meeting in the morning so there wouldn't be time, but if she has
   time how why couldn't we go to new york? Drive up really close, get a motel,
   spend the day in the city. Go to the Met Museum of Art. Look at the
   buildings come back. How would we deal with a car in NY (on an on hotels
   costs, trains, planes, tents, stay with friends). If we did discover we are
   able to do things like this how would the other kids feel that they had
   never had the chance, can I afford to takes Steph and Ely along also?
   Breath, breath, who is telling me these things? What if I lose my job, I
   have enough money to live for a year. Maybe I could just take the year off
   and commit suicide when I am out of money, yeah but then my kids would have
   no inheritance - that's seems unfair and selfish. Well maybe I should kill
   myself before I leave the company, they will have to give me a 2 weeks
   notice - in that time I could learn how to die in a way that the company
   life insurance will need to payout to the kids, and I should be able to
   attain a very productive and peaceful state of mind that I won't be overly
   hassled by the whole difficulty of figuring it out and pulling it off - I'll
   still have a great time in those 2 weeks and everything will be for the
   best. Breathing, well I am getting kind of old, just another 11 years and
   I'll be getting Social security, why can't I hold out a little longer.
   Breath, breath. One thing is sure I will get some blueberries and cream this
   morning, but the blueberries are $3.99 a pint a giant, I'll go to
   macgruder's, then have cereal with blueberries and coffee with sugar and
   cream, I'll walk over, who is giving the directives?</p> 

   <h2>20041023 Dream</h2>
   <p>
   we are traveling through long twisting narrow convoluted tunnels made of
   wood and paper and wire.  There is a cable to pull yourself inch by inch
   through right angle corners head first.  I discover that there is a method,
   available only on return routes, to get the cable to move and pull you
   through the mazes, this is such a relief compared to all the hard
   uncomfortable effort to force yourself along.  I share this info with
   others.
   </p><p>
   I run out to pee over a wire link fence, the normal place to pee, but there
   are people there who do not know this is normal, and I put it away without
   relief. I go back through a dwelling of many rooms (maybe a quarter mile
   walk) ending up going to my (my parent's house on Lincklaen St) - being
   followed by a young boy and his Dad - they are not welcome in my house, and
   they exit through the garage before entering the house.
   </p>
   <p>
    I decide I need a gun for protection.  I am wondering about a pistol vs a
    rifle when I find two big (bigger than 22) rifles in the garage.  I go to
    the back yard and fire one of the guns, I know this is not legal in town,
    but hope know one who notices will focus on it enough to complain.  I fire
    a second shot.  I go out to the barn, but before I can enter I encounter a
    gopher who lives under the floor right just inside the door.  We examine
    each other a bit and then the gopher charges me.  I raise the rifle and
    aim, this results in a stalemate with the gopher pushing up against the
    barrel of the gun.  I decide not to shoot, nor to back down.  I swing the
    gun back and forth and up and down, whacking the beast on head.  I cannot
    hit him very hard since I am keeping the gun to my cheek, and not getting a
    wide swing, since I don't want to give up the option of shooting if he
    attacks in earnest.  This is ridiculous, I bump him and he stares back
    evaluating the strength of each hit, which seems to be unpleasant but not
    really awful.  We do this for a while.
    </p><p>

    I go back to the house and notice the big SUV that has been sitting there
    unused for weeks since we rented it to visit Mom in the hospital.  I think
    that it would have been fun to use that when I took Susan out last night.
    Wondering why I haven't been driving it instead of leaving it idle - I
    realize that it should have been returned to the rental company, and it now
    probably has a bill of thousands of dollars....

    <h2>20041023 thoughts about religion</h2>
    <p>
    "The world is not made of atoms, it is made of stories"
   </p><p>
   "The significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them." Albert Einstein
   </p><p>
   What is religion? Is religion evil? Is religion true Is religion defensible?
   </p><p>
   Religion as revealed Truth.
   </p><p>
   Is there any rational bases for believing that  superior intelligent
   being(s) are in control of our destiny and have some interest in us.  Could
   there ever be any evidence?  I think the answer to both of these questions
   is clearly negative. The more fundamentalist and particular you get about
   it, the more obviously it is that there is no reason to give credibility to
   this.  
   </p><p>
   Take the notion that the Bible is revealed truth, the literal word by word
   by word of God and each word is literacy true.  In the case of the Bible
   there are endless practical problems with this claim.  Which version of the
   Bible is the true Bible?  What about the often repeated places where the
   same story is repeated with a clearly different set of events within the
   Bible itself.  What about the fact that one can track the B as a historical
   literal document and that it changes over time, that G is not consistent but
   seems to change in step with human history?   
   </p><p>
   Religion is given some credit for many of the great and small atrocities
   through out history.  People say that the genocide of the new world peoples,
   the Spanish Inquisition, the Crusades, the long history of murder and
   torture between the Catholics vs the Potestants, the Jews vs the Muslims and
   endless smaller acts of cruelty, inhumanity, bigotry, and personal betrayal.
   The thought is that religion allows the person to justify the unjustifiable
   by reference to the serving of a "higher" truth.
   </p><p>

   Religion is given credit for many of the great acts of  through out history.
   The brave Franciscans attempting to save the Incas in spirit and body, the
   good Samaritan, every day kindness performed by people serving a higher
   truth.

   Need to make this brief and get some sleep. 4 more years of George Bush -
   this is very worrisome. Went to work, examined high costs of mainframe time
   sharing during the past year - about $111,000 - much too high, I expected
   less. Spend time examining charges, discovered some apparent double billing
   &amp; documented it to Ray Danner. Worked with Chuck - outlined some software
   charges to reduce the cost of weekly background "TOSAS" jobs. Worked with
   Michael to identify files to get offline. Worked on Java program to update
   Background on local server. At home I listen to the radio about the election
   results, listen to some music, Finished typing Dad's 1951 Journal. The best
   story of the day was about a man who entered a lion installation at a zoo,
   asking the lions to accept Jesus as their Saviour. He was bit in the leg.
